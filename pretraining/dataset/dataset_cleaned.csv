"Telecom Networks are systems of interconnected communication devices and equipment that enable people to communicate with each other over long distances. These networks use various technologies and protocols to facilitate the transmission of voice, data, and video signals between devices, including smartphones, computers, and other communication devices. Telecom networks play a critical role in modern society, providing essential communication services to individuals, businesses, and organizations. They enable people to communicate with each other across vast distances, enabling global communication and facilitating international trade and commerce."
"Telecom Networks are made up of various components, including transmission systems, switching systems, and network management systems. These components work together to ensure that communication signals are transmitted and delivered efficiently and securely."
"In recent years, telecom networks have evolved significantly, driven by advances in technology and changing communication needs. Modern networks use advanced technologies like 5G, fiber-optic cables, and cloud computing to provide faster, more reliable communication services to users. Telecom networks are essential components of modern communication infrastructure, enabling people to communicate and connect with each other in new and innovative ways."
Telecom Networks are mostly used today for wide-area communication. Stringing a wire between every pair of telephones that might want to communicate was not a good long-term strategy. A better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office. There an operator could connect one telephone to another via a switchboard.
"Routing a Telephone Call: A call is routed up through higher-level switching offices until it reaches a switching office that can reach the destination telephone by connecting with lower-level switching offices, which examine the digits of the telephone number you dialed to make these decisions."
"Connection-Oriented Services – I: A dedicated connection between the endpoints is maintained throughout the session. Usually, this means that the quality of service can be reasonably guaranteed to the extent of the bandwidth for the channel that is established. Message bits arrive in the same order in which they are sent. A traditional telephone circuit is a circuit-switched connection-oriented system."
"Transmission Media in Telephone Systems: In traditional analog telephone systems, the telephone is connected to the local exchange via category 3 UTP cables. This connection is called the local loop. It is typically between 1km and 10km in length. Higher up in the hierarchy, higher bandwidth cables are used to carry multiple telephone calls. This is far cheaper than using separate cables for separate calls. Specifically, digital lines on fiber are used. Analog systems used a technique called frequency division multiplexing (FDM) to do this."
"The Local Loop: The subscriber handsets are powered by a battery bank in the exchange. With echo suppressors, the transmission is half-duplex. With echo cancellers, it is possible to have full-duplex communication. Since the local loop is still analog, we need modems for sending digital data. Since one bit is used for control purposes, we usually get 56kbps speed. Depending on the line condition, modems may automatically negotiate a lower speed."
"Signaling: Signaling refers to the information exchanges between terminal devices, exchanges, and routers for setting up circuits, termination, billing, advanced network services, etc. In common Channel signaling which is in the band, some of the bits in the frame are used for this purpose, in which SS7 is considered standard. Whether In-band or Out of band, logically the switch controllers may be considered to be an overlay network in the control plane. Out-of-band signaling (CCIS – Common Channel Interoffice Signaling) is more flexible as it allows arbitrarily complex message transfer, as they do not interfere with the regular channel."
Telecom networks are systems of interconnected communication devices and equipment that allow people to communicate with each other over long distances.
"Digital Technology in Telephone Networks: Over the past 30 years, much of the traditional analog telephone network has been replaced by digital technology. A device called a codec (coder/decoder) is used to convert analog voice signals into digital information that can be handled by digital technology. The codec is also used to convert the digital signals back into analog voice signals that can be handled by the older analog technology."
Only the local loop is still analog and this loop can be replaced by Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections. It was envisaged as an end-to-end digital service. Home users would be connected by the same Cat3 cable. the digital bit streams are time-multiplexed. The system uses Out band signaling and uses the D channel for that. NT1 is a network terminating device which connects to the ISDN exchange on one side and a local passive bus on the other from which up to eight terminal devices can hang. ISDN turned out to be very expensive and obsolete even before the standard was finalized. The vision of broadband ISDN was sought to be realized by ATM.
Digital Subscriber Loop: The next attempt for converting the analog local loop went in two directions:
"It is impossible to overestimate the influence of telecom networks on society. They have completely changed how people interact with one another and conduct business on a global scale. It’s difficult to remember a period before wireless technology, which enables us to connect from anywhere at any time, existed."
"To despite certain drawbacks like addiction and privacy invasion, these are greatly overshadowed by the advantages they provide. As technology advances, telecom networks will continue to expand and change; the future should excite us as well."
The OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components.
"TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model."
"The number of layers is sometimes referred to as five or four. Here In this article, we’ll study five layers. The Physical Layer and Data Link Layer are referred to as one single layer as the ‘Physical Layer’ or ‘Network Interface Layer’ in the 4-layer reference."
"The main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end."
"TCP and IP are different protocols of Computer Networks. The basic difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) is in the transmission of data. In simple words, IP finds the destination of the mail and TCP has the work to send and receive the mail. UDP is another protocol, which does not require IP to communicate with another computer. IP is required by only TCP. This is the basic difference between TCP and IP."
"Whenever we want to send something over the internet using the TCP/IP Model, the TCP/IP Model divides the data into packets at the sender’s end and the same packets have to be recombined at the receiver’s end to form the same data, and this thing happens to maintain the accuracy of the data. TCP/IP model divides the data into a 4-layer procedure, where the data first go into this layer in one order and again in reverse order to get organized in the same way at the receiver’s end."
"For more, you can refer to TCP/IP in Computer Networking."
The diagrammatic comparison of the TCP/IP and OSI model is as follows:
"It is a group of applications requiring network communications. This layer is responsible for generating the data and requesting connections. It acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver. During this article, we will be talking on the behalf of the receiver."
"The packet’s network protocol type, in this case, TCP/IP, is identified by the data-link layer. Error prevention and “framing” are also provided by the data-link layer. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) framing and Ethernet IEEE 802.2 framing are two examples of data-link layer protocols."
This layer parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols residing at this layer are as follows:
"The Internet Layer is a layer in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which is the set of protocols that define the Internet. The Internet Layer is responsible for routing packets of data from one device to another across a network. It does this by assigning each device a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and determine the route that packets should take to reach it."
"Example: Imagine that you are using a computer to send an email to a friend. When you click “send,” the email is broken down into smaller packets of data, which are then sent to the Internet Layer for routing. The Internet Layer assigns an IP address to each packet and uses routing tables to determine the best route for the packet to take to reach its destination. The packet is then forwarded to the next hop on its route until it reaches its destination. When all of the packets have been delivered, your friend’s computer can reassemble them into the original email message."
"In this example, the Internet Layer plays a crucial role in delivering the email from your computer to your friend’s computer. It uses IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best route for the packets to take, and it ensures that the packets are delivered to the correct destination. Without the Internet Layer, it would not be possible to send data across the Internet."
The TCP/IP transport layer protocols exchange data receipt acknowledgments and retransmit missing packets to ensure that packets arrive in order and without error. End-to-end communication is referred to as such. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol are transport layer protocols at this level (UDP).
This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The three main protocols present in this layer are:
The host-to-host layer is a layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that is responsible for providing communication between hosts (computers or other devices) on a network. It is also known as the transport layer.
"Example: Consider a network with two hosts, A and B. Host A wants to send a file to host B. The host-to-host layer in host A will break the file into smaller segments, add error correction and flow control information, and then transmit the segments over the network to host B. The host-to-host layer in host B will receive the segments, check for errors, and reassemble the file. Once the file has been transferred successfully, the host-to-host layer in host B will acknowledge receipt of the file to host A."
"In this example, the host-to-host layer is responsible for providing a reliable connection between host A and host B, breaking the file into smaller segments, and reassembling the segments at the destination. It is also responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing the data and providing end-to-end communication between the two hosts."
TCP/IP Model covers many Internet Protocols. The main rule of these Internet Protocols is how the data is validated and sent over the Internet. Some Common Internet Protocols include:
"Internetworking is combined of 2 words, inter and networking which implies an association between totally different nodes or segments. This connection area unit is established through intercessor devices akin to routers or gateway. The first term for associate degree internetwork was catenet. This interconnection is often among or between public, private, commercial, industrial, or governmental networks. Thus, associate degree internetwork could be an assortment of individual networks, connected by intermediate networking devices, that function as one giant network. Internetworking refers to the trade, products, and procedures that meet the challenge of making and administering internet works."
"To enable communication, every individual network node or phase is designed with a similar protocol or communication logic, that is Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP). Once a network communicates with another network having constant communication procedures, it’s called Internetworking. Internetworking was designed to resolve the matter of delivering a packet of information through many links."
There is a minute difference between extending the network and Internetworking. Merely exploitation of either a switch or a hub to attach 2 local area networks is an extension of LAN whereas connecting them via the router is an associate degree example of Internetworking. Internetworking is enforced in Layer three (Network Layer) of the OSI-ISO model. The foremost notable example of internetworking is the Internet.
"Intranets and extranets might or might not have connections to the net. If there is a connection to the net, the computer network or extranet area unit is usually shielded from being accessed from the net if it is not authorized. The net isn’t thought-about to be a section of the computer network or extranet, though it should function as a portal for access to parts of the associate degree extranet."
"Internetworking has evolved as an answer to a few key problems: isolated LANs, duplication of resources, and an absence of network management. Isolated LANs created transmission problems between totally different offices or departments. Duplication of resources meant that constant hardware and code had to be provided to every workplace or department, as did a separate support employee. This lack of network management meant that no centralized methodology of managing and troubleshooting networks existed."
"One more form of the interconnection of networks usually happens among enterprises at the Link Layer of the networking model, i.e. at the hardware-centric layer below the amount of the TCP/IP logical interfaces. Such interconnection is accomplished through network bridges and network switches. This can be typically incorrectly termed internetworking, however, the ensuing system is just a bigger, single subnetwork, and no internetworking protocol, akin to web Protocol, is needed to traverse these devices."
"However, one electronic network is also reborn into associate degree internetwork by dividing the network into phases and logically dividing the segment traffic with routers. The Internet Protocol is meant to supply an associate degree unreliable packet service across the network. The design avoids intermediate network components maintaining any state of the network. Instead, this task is allotted to the endpoints of every communication session. To transfer information correctly, applications should utilize associate degree applicable Transport Layer protocol, akin to Transmission management Protocol (TCP), that provides a reliable stream. Some applications use a less complicated, connection-less transport protocol, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for tasks that don’t need reliable delivery of information or that need period of time service, akin to video streaming or voice chat."
"Internetwork addresses establish devices severally or as members of a bunch. Addressing schemes differ based on the protocol family and therefore the OSI layer. Three kinds of internetwork addresses area units are ordinarily used: data-link layer addresses, Media Access control (MAC) addresses, and network-layer addresses."
"Implementing useful internetwork isn’t at any certainty. There are several challenging fields, particularly in the areas of dependableness, connectivity, network management, and adaptability, and each and every space is essential in establishing associate degree economical and effective internetwork. A few of them are:-"
"Increased connectivity: Internetworking enables devices on different networks to communicate with each other, which increases connectivity and enables new applications and services."
"Resource sharing: Internetworking allows devices to share resources across networks, such as printers, servers, and storage devices. This can reduce costs and improve efficiency by allowing multiple devices to share resources."
Improved scalability: Internetworking allows networks to be expanded and scaled as needed to accommodate growing numbers of devices and users.
"Improved collaboration: Internetworking enables teams and individuals to collaborate and work together more effectively, regardless of their physical location."
"Access to remote resources: Internetworking allows users to access resources and services that are physically located on remote networks, improving accessibility and flexibility."
"Security risks: Internetworking can create security vulnerabilities and increase the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Connecting multiple networks together increases the number of entry points for attackers, making it more difficult to secure the entire system."
Complexity: Internetworking can be complex and requires specialized knowledge and expertise to set up and maintain. This can increase costs and create additional maintenance overhead.
"Performance issues: Internetworking can lead to performance issues, particularly if networks are not properly optimized and configured. This can result in slow response times and poor network performance."
"Compatibility issues: Internetworking can lead to compatibility issues, particularly if different networks are using different protocols or technologies. This can make it difficult to integrate different systems and may require additional resources to resolve."
"Management overhead: Internetworking can create additional management overhead, particularly if multiple networks are involved. This can increase costs and require additional resources to manage effectively.References: Internetworking – Wiki Introduction to Internetworking"
"Internet Of Everything (IoE) has been one of the trending topics lately, and it’s here, IoE is the upcoming most innovative and Ubiquitous technology advancement which is going to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before. Turning information into action creates new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunities for businesses, individuals, and countries."
"Technically, IoE refers to billions of devices and consumer products connected to the internet in an intelligent networked environment with expanded digital features."
"It is basically a philosophy in which our technology future is composed of different types of appliances, devices, and things connected to the global internet. As of now, the internet connection is only restricted to phone/Tablets, PCs, and a handful of other devices but the idea behind IoE is that in the future, machines will become more intelligent and cognitive by having more access to data and expanded network opportunities."
"In simpler terms, IoE is the intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things that will be transforming our world in such a way that there will be billions of connected devices having sensors to detect, measure and access their status all of which will be connected over a public or private network built over standard protocols like TCP/IP."
So how is the; Internet of Everything any different from the Internet of Things?
"Well, the difference is the intelligent connection. IoT is mostly about physical devices and objects communicating with each other, but IoE brings with it network intelligence to bind all these concepts together into a cohesive system."
"IoT has been limited to only machines thus achieving Machine Machine Communication but IoE brings together people, processes, data, and things and adds them into the network therefore not just phones/tablets and PCs but people. Health Fitness bands, Coffee pots, and Marine Container’s all become a Node in an intelligent network communicating with each other. The more expansive IoE concepts include, besides M2M communication, M2P, and technology-assisted P2P communication."
The IoE Economy will profoundly affect four major Aspects of our lives:
"As of 1984, only 1000 devices were connected to the internet which increased to about 1 million in 1992 and shot across 10 Billion in 2010, and as Cisco predicts there will be around 50 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020. These devices will be fetching data from their environment internally or externally and sending it back to the server for analyzing and making much more intelligent decisions."
"Here the data is more about insightful information and action plan than just a random chunk. Figuring out a way to decipher the right flow of information is the key to making the best use of Big Data and as the types of data and sources increase, in order to draw useful insight there will be a need to classify information and analyze it."
"General Electrics predicts that IoE can add 15 trillion dollars to the Global Domestic Product while Cisco estimates 19 trillion in savings and profits for companies that can leverage IoE. But as the number of devices connected to the internet increase and therefore collect more data, privacy is put at risk which increases security concerns, but as these devices grow more intelligent, hopes are that the device and network will grow knowledgeable enough to detect, stop and prevent any harmful threats. IoE is here and is inevitable, we should embrace ourselves to adapt our lives to the changes that it brings with it."
"IOE has the potential to manage different fields, several industry verticals are accepting IOE to speed up their daily operations."

"These are just a few advantages and disadvantages of IoE. While IoE offers many benefits, it also poses various challenges and risks that need to be addressed for successful implementation."
Switched communication networks are those in which data transferred from source to destination is routed between various intermediate nodes. Switching is the technique by which nodes control or switch data to transmit it between specific points on a network. There are 3 common switching techniques:
"Message Switching – Message switching was a technique developed as an alternative to circuit switching before packet switching was introduced. In message switching, end-users communicate by sending and receiving messages that included the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest individual unit. Also, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. There are a number of intermediate nodes that transfer data and ensure that the message reaches its destination. Message switched data networks are hence called hop-by-hop systems."
"Message switching network consists of transmission links (channels), store-and-forward switch nodes, and end stations as shown in the following picture:"
"Characteristics of message switching – Message switching is advantageous as it enables efficient usage of network resources. Also, because of the store-and-forward capability of intermediary nodes, traffic can be efficiently regulated and controlled. Message delivery as one unit, rather than in pieces, is another benefit."
"However, message switching has certain disadvantages as well. Since messages are stored indefinitely at each intermediate node, switches require a large storage capacity. Also, these are pretty slow. This is because at each node, first there is a wait till the entire message is received, then it must be stored and transmitted after processing the next node and links to it depending on availability and channel traffic. Hence, message switching cannot be used for real-time or interactive applications like a video conference."
Advantages of Message Switching – Message switching has the following advantages:
Disadvantages of Message Switching – Message switching has the following disadvantages:
"Applications – The store-and-forward method was implemented in telegraph message switching centres. Today, although many major networks and systems are packet-switched or circuit-switched networks, their delivery processes can be based on message switching. For example, in most electronic mail systems the delivery process is based on message switching, while the network is in fact either circuit-switched or packet-switched."
"Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) – The CSMA method does not tell us what to do in case there is a collision. Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) adds to the CSMA algorithm to deal with the collision. In CSMA/CD, the size of a frame must be large enough so that collision can be detected by the sender while sending the frame. So, the frame transmission delay must be at least two times the maximum propagation delay. Assume some station transmitted data packet and successfully get to the destination but it is just the Best Case, so we have to take the Worst Case scenario in which there will be contention slots. Contention slots are those slots that are not able to transmit their journey due to the collision. Suppose station A transmitted data but collide and the worst-case time wasted is 2Tp and then some station B found out a way to transmit the data so it took (As shown in Figure)"
"Now we don’t know how many contention slots, so we consider the worst-case to be of n contention slots."
"In CSMA/CD, for success, only 1 station should transmit while others shouldn’t. Let p be the probability to transmit data successfully."
"For max P(success), differentiate with respect to p and equate to zero (to get maxima and minima)."
Number of times we need to try before getting 1st success
"Here number of times we need to try (C) = e. Put a = Tt/Tp and divide by T in Efficiency = Tt / (C* 2 * Tp + Tt + Tp) We get,"
GATE CS Corner Questions Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. All questions have been asked in GATE in previous years or in GATE Mock Tests. It is highly recommended that you practice them.
"In controlled access, the stations seek information from one another to find which station has the right to send. It allows only one node to send at a time, to avoid the collision of messages on a shared medium. The three controlled-access methods are:"
"The following figure shows a situation with five stations and a five-slot reservation frame. In the first interval, only stations 1, 3, and 4 have made reservations. In the second interval, only station 1 has made a reservation."
"Efficiency Let Tpoll be the time for polling and Tt be the time required for transmission of data. Then,"
Performance of token ring can be concluded by 2 parameters:-
"Data link layer is responsible for something called Framing, which is the division of a stream of bits from the network layer into manageable units (called frames). Each frame consists of the sender’s address and a destination address. The destination address defines where the packet is to go and the sender’s address helps the recipient acknowledge the receipt. Frames could be fixed size or variable size. In fixed-size framing, there is no need for defining the boundaries of the frames as the size itself can be used to define the end of the frame and the beginning of the next frame. But, in variable-size framing, we need a way to define the end of the frame and the beginning of the next frame. To separate one frame from the next, an 8-bit (or 1-byte) flag is added at the beginning and the end of a frame. But the problem with that is, any pattern used for the flag could also be part of the information. So, there are two ways to overcome this problem:"
"Byte stuffing is a byte (usually escape character(ESC)), which has a predefined bit pattern is added to the data section of the frame when there is a character with the same pattern as the flag. Whenever the receiver encounters the ESC character, it removes it from the data section and treats the next character as data, not a flag. But the problem arises when the text contains one or more escape characters followed by a flag. To solve this problem, the escape characters that are part of the text are marked by another escape character i.e., if the escape character is part of the text, an extra one is added to show that the second one is part of the text."
"Bit stuffing – Mostly flag is a special 8-bit pattern “01111110” used to define the beginning and the end of the frame. Problem with the flag is the same as that was in the case of byte stuffing. So, in this protocol what we do is, if we encounter 0 and five consecutive 1 bits, an extra 0 is added after these bits. This extra stuffed bit is removed from the data by the receiver. The extra bit is added after one 0 followed by five 1 bits regardless of the value of the next bit. Also, as the sender side always knows which sequence is data and which is flag it will only add this extra bit in the data sequence, not in the flag sequence."
"Byte stuffing: It is used to convert a message format of a sequence of bytes that may contain reserved values into another byte sequence that does not contain reserved values. It is also known as character-oriented framing. Here, a special byte is stuffed before flag and esc also that special byte is escape(ESC)."
"Bit stuffing: It is used for inserting one or more non-information bits into a message to be transmitted, to break message sequence for synchronization. It is also known as bit-oriented framing. Here,0 bit stuffed after five consecutive 1 bits.i.e extra bit is added after five consecutive ones."
"Basic frame format which is required for all MAC implementation is defined in IEEE 802.3 standard. Though several optional formats are being used to extend the protocol’s basic capability. Ethernet frame starts with Preamble and SFD, both work at the physical layer. Ethernet header contains both the Source and Destination MAC address, after which the payload of the frame is present. The last field is CRC which is used to detect the error. Now, let’s study each field of basic frame format."
"Standard IEEE 802.3 basic frame format is discussed above in detail. Now let’s see the extended Ethernet frame header, using which we can get a Payload even larger than 1500 Bytes."
"DA [Destination MAC Address]: 6 bytes SA [Source MAC Address]: 6 bytes Type [0x8870 (Ethertype)]: 2 bytes DSAP [802.2 Destination Service Access Point] : 1 byte SSAP [802.2 Source Service Access Point] : 1 byte Ctrl [802.2 Control Field] : 1-byte Data [Protocol Data] : > 46 bytes FCS [Frame Checksum]: 4 bytes Although length field is missing in Ethernet II frame, the frame length is known by virtue of the frame being accepted by the network interface. GATE CS Corner Questions Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. All questions have been asked in GATE in previous years or in GATE Mock Tests. It is highly recommended that you practice them."
"Simple format: The Ethernet frame format is simple and easy to understand, making it easy to implement and troubleshoot Ethernet networks."
"Flexibility: The Ethernet frame format is flexible and can accommodate different data sizes and network topologies, making it suitable for a wide range of network applications."
"Widely adopted: The Ethernet frame format is widely adopted and supported by a large number of vendors and network devices, ensuring compatibility and interoperability."
"Error detection: The Ethernet frame format includes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) field for error detection, which helps to ensure data integrity during transmission."
"Support for VLANs: The Ethernet frame format supports virtual local area networks (VLANs), which allows network administrators to logically partition a physical LAN into multiple smaller virtual LANs for improved network management and security."
"Limited frame size: The Ethernet frame format has a maximum frame size of 1500 bytes, which can limit the amount of data that can be transmitted in a single frame and can result in increased overhead due to fragmentation and reassembly of larger packets."
"Broadcast storms: Ethernet networks use broadcast transmissions to send frames to all devices on the network, which can lead to broadcast storms if too many devices send broadcast frames simultaneously, resulting in network congestion and performance issues."
"Security vulnerabilities: The Ethernet frame format does not include built-in security features, making Ethernet networks vulnerable to security threats such as eavesdropping and spoofing."
"Limited speed: Ethernet networks have a limited maximum speed, which may not be sufficient for high-speed applications or large-scale networks."
"Limited distance: The maximum distance between two devices on an Ethernet network is limited, which can restrict the physical coverage of the network."

"Multiplexing means multiple sources but one link. An alternative approach is a Direct Point to point-to-point connection but it has several problems as it requires an I/O port for each device, a need line for each device, and also a large amount of wiring needed if on different floors. Instead, if we use a multiplexer approach then all devices are connected to MUX and one line to the host, the link carries multiple channels of information and several lines equal to the number of lines out."
"Multiplexing is the sharing of a medium or bandwidth. It is the process in which multiple signals coming from multiple sources are combined and transmitted over a single communication/physical line. Multiplexing in computer networks is done using a device Multiplexer called MUX that takes ‘n’ input lines to generate a single output line. On the other hand, there is a device called DEMUX(Demultiplexer) that takes a single input line and generates ‘n’ output lines."
"The ‘n’ input lines shown above are transmitted via a multiplexer and it combines the signals to form a composite signal. Now, these signals are passed through DEMUX and it transfers those signals to their respective destinations."
"The frequency spectrum is divided among the logical channels and each user has exclusive access to his channel. It sends signals in several distinct frequency ranges and carries multiple video channels on a single cable. Each signal is modulated onto a different carrier frequency and carrier frequencies are separated by guard bands. The bandwidth of the transmission medium exceeds the required bandwidth of all the signals. Usually, for frequency division multiplexing analog signaling is used in order to transmit the signals, i.e. more susceptible to noise. Assignment of non-overlapping frequency ranges to each user or signal on a medium. Thus, all signals are transmitted at the same time, each using different frequencies."
The multiplexer is attached to the high-speed communication line. The frequency spectrum is divided up among the logical channels where each user hangs onto a particular frequency. The radio spectrum is an example of the media and the mechanism for extracting information from the medium.
"Each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth for a small burst of time, i.e. entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time. It is very extensively used in computer communication and telecommunication. Sharing of the channel is accomplished by dividing available transmission time on a medium among users. It exclusively uses Digital Signaling instead of dividing the cable into frequency bands. TDM splits cable usage into time slots. The data rate of transmission media exceeds the data rate of signals. Uses a frame and one slot for each slice of time and the time slots are transmitted whether the source has data or not."
There are two types of TDMs which are as follows:
"Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing: It is synchronous because the multiplexer and the de-multiplexer have to agree on the time slots. The original time-division multiplexing. The multiplexer accepts input from attached devices in a round-robin fashion and transmits the data in a never-ending pattern. Some common examples of this are T-1 and ISDN telephone lines. If one device generates data at a faster rate than other devices, then the multiplexor must either sample the incoming data stream from that device more often than it samples the other devices or buffers the faster incoming stream. If a device has nothing to transmit, the multiplexor must still insert a piece of data from that device into the multiplexed stream."
"Statistical Time Division Multiplexing: It is a time-division but on-demand rather than fixed, rescheduling links on a per-packet basis and packets from different sources interleaved on the link. It allows the connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit. Works on the premise that not all the nodes will transmit at full capacity at all times. It must transmit a terminal identification i.e destination id no. and may require storage. A statistical multiplexer transmits only the data from active workstations. If a workstation is not active, no space is wasted on the multiplexed stream. It accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame containing only the data to be transmitted."
"Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing: It is a type of multiplexing, where the rate of sampling is different and also does not require a general clock, it is called Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing. Asynchronous TDMs have generally low bandwidth. In case when there is nothing to transmit, this type of TDM gives its time slot to other devices."
"Interleaving Time Division Multiplexing: Interleaving TDM can be taken as two switches rotating at high speed, one on the multiplexing and the other on the demultiplexing surface. These switches can also be rotated in the reverse direction. At once, when it leaves the surface of multiplexing and releases at the surface of de-multiplexer, it is called Interleaving."
"It is the same as FDM but applied to fibers, only the difference is that here the operating frequencies are much higher actually they are in the optical range. There’s great potential for fibers since the bandwidth is so huge. Fibers with different energy bands are passed through a diffraction grating prism. Combined on the long-distance link and then split at the destination. It has got high reliability and very high capacity."
It multiplexes multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic line. Different wavelength lasers(called lambdas) transmit multiple signals. Each signal carried on the fiber can be transmitted at a different rate from the other signals.
There are some more types of multiplexing that are discussed here.
"It is a type of multiplexing where each code is distributed among different spectrums so that each one of them can work at the same time simultaneously. It is also called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). CDMA makes use of spectrum technology along with analog-to-digital conversion(ADC). It is thus used by various radio communication technologies. Mainly, it is used for mobile communication."
"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital communication technique initially developed for use in cable television systems. OFDM is similar to the broadcasting technique known as frequency division multiplexing (also known as FDM), which uses a multitude of transmitters and receivers to send information on different frequencies over a single wire, such as an electrical power cable."
Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) is the combination of Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). It basically means that a particular channel is used against a particular frequency band for some time.
"Q.1: Let us consider a statistical time division multiplexing of packets. The number of sources is 10. In a time unit, a source transmits a packet of 1000 bits. The number of sources sending data for the first 20 time units is 6, 9, 3, 7, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 10, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 2, 9, 5 respectively. The output capacity of multiplexer is 5000 bits per time unit. Then the average number of backlogged of packets per time unit during the given period is [GATE IT 2007]."
"For detailed explanation, refer to GATE | Gate IT 2007 | Question 60."
There are two kinds of network Adapters. A wired adapter allows us to set up a connection to a modem or router via Ethernet in a computer whereas a wireless adapter identifies and connects to remote hot spots. Each adapter has a distinct label known as a MAC address which recognizes and authenticates the computer. Mac address is shown in the format of 00:00:00:00:00:00 or 00-00-00-00-00-00.
"MAC filtering is a security method based on access control. In this, each address is assigned a 48-bit address which is used to determine whether we can access a network or not. It helps in listing a set of allowed devices that you need on your Wi-Fi and the list of denied devices that you don’t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. In a way, we can deny list or allow a list of certain computers based on their MAC address. We can configure the filter to allow connection only to those devices included in the white list. White lists provide greater security than denied lists because the router grants access only to selected devices."
"It is used on enterprise wireless networks having multiple access points to prevent clients from communicating with each other. The access point can be configured to only allow clients to talk to the default gateway, but not other wireless clients. It increases the efficiency of access to a network"
"The router allows configuring a list of allowed MAC addresses in its web interface, allowing you to choose which devices can connect to your network. The router has a number of functions designed to improve the security of the network but not all are useful. Media access control may seem advantageous but there are certain flaws. On a wireless network, the device with the proper credentials such as SSID and password can authenticate with the router and join the network which gets an IP address and access to the internet and any shared resources."
"MAC address filtering adds an extra layer of security that checks the device’s MAC address against a list of agreed addresses. If the client’s address matches one on the router’s list, access is granted otherwise it doesn’t join the network."
"For enabling a list of allowed, denied or both devices follow the steps given below."
Note that if MAC Filtering is enabled on a wireless router and the MAC address is not entered then the wireless device connected to the router will not be able to connect We do not need to enable MAC Filtering if this is already disabled for troubleshooting purposes. Router manufacturers are more knowledgeable in this field.
"Security – By examining the packet using Wireshark hackers with a toolset like Kali Linux can access the network as they can get the MAC address of allowed devices and then they can change their device’s MAC address to the allowed MAC address and connect posing as that device. They can use “deauth”or “deassoc” attack that forcefully disconnects a device from a Wi-Fi network or use airplay-ng to send disassociation packets to the clients and then connect in the device’s place. However, MAC addresses of wireless clients can’t truly be changed because they’re encoded in the hardware. But some critics spotted that MAC addresses can be faked. All an attacker needs to do is to know one of the valid addresses. They don’t have to break the encryption to access your network or crack your WPA2 encrypted password. They just have to pretend to be a trusted computer."
"MAC filtering will prevent average hackers from gaining network access. Most computer users don’t know how to trick their MAC address let alone find a router’s list of approved addresses. Unlike domain filter, they do not stop traffic from flowing through the network."
"A general doubt that arises is how the hackers can get our MAC address if they can’t connect to the network. It is a weakness of Wi-Fi that even if there is a WPA2 encrypted network, the MAC addresses on those packets are not encrypted. This means that anyone with network sniffing software installed and a wireless card in a range of your network can easily grab all the MAC addresses that are communicating with your router."
"Hypothetically, the probability of halting pernicious organization action increments when a switch really looks at this association prior to conceding gadgets. Yet, by dissecting the parcel utilizing Wireshark, programmers utilizing a toolset, for example, Kali Linux can get to the organization since they can get the Macintosh locations of supported gadgets, then, at that point, the aggressor can change its gadget’s Macintosh address to the permitted Macintosh address and interface by taking on the appearance of that gadget. They can utilize the “deauth” or “deassoc” assaults, which powerfully segregate a gadget from a Wi-Fi organization, or they can use airplay-ng, which sends disassociation bundles to clients and afterward interfaces in the gadget’s place."
"Then again, the Macintosh locations of remote clients can’t be changed on the grounds that they are encoded in the equipment. Notwithstanding, a few pundits have brought up that Macintosh locations can be manufactured. An aggressor just needs to know one of the real locations. They don’t have to break the encryption or break your WPA2 scrambled secret phrase to get sufficiently close to your organization. The assailants need to act like a confided in PC."
"A typical inquiry emerges to you that how these programmers got our Macintosh address assuming that they couldn’t interface with the organization. Regardless of whether there is a WPA2 scrambled network, the Macintosh tends to on those bundles are not encoded. This implies that anybody having network sniffing programming and a remote card close enough to your organization can undoubtedly catch all of the Macintosh tends to converse with your switch."
In circuit switching network resources (bandwidth) are divided into pieces and bit delay is constant during a connection. The dedicated path/circuit established between sender and receiver provides a guaranteed data rate. Data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established.
Telephone system network is one of the example of Circuit switching. TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) and FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) are two methods of multiplexing multiple signals into a single carrier.
"Inefficient use of resources: Circuit switching requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path between two nodes, which means that the resources along that path, such as bandwidth and switch ports, are reserved for the duration of the communication. This can result in inefficient use of resources, as the resources may remain unused during periods of low or no communication."
"Limited scalability: Circuit switching is not well-suited for large-scale networks with many nodes, as it requires a dedicated communication path between each pair of nodes. This can result in a high degree of complexity and difficulty in managing the network."
"Vulnerability to failures: Circuit switching relies on a dedicated communication path, which can make the network vulnerable to failures, such as cable cuts or switch failures. In the event of a failure, the communication path must be re-established, which can result in delays or loss of data."
"Delay and latency: Circuit switching requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path, which can result in delay and latency in establishing the path and transmitting data. This can impact the real-time performance of applications, such as voice and video."
"High cost: Circuit switching requires the reservation of resources, which can result in a high cost, particularly in large-scale networks. This can make circuit switching less practical for some applications."
"Lack of flexibility: Circuit switching is not flexible as it only allows one type of communication at a time, such as voice or data. This can limit the ability of users to perform multiple tasks simultaneously."
"Limited mobility: Circuit switching is not well-suited for mobile devices or nodes that move frequently, as it requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path. This can result in communication disruptions or dropped calls."
Limited capacity: Circuit switching can have limited capacity as it requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path between two nodes. This can limit the number of simultaneous communications that can occur.
High setup time: Circuit switching requires a significant setup time to establish the dedicated communication path between two nodes. This can result in delays in initiating communication.
"No prioritization: Circuit switching does not provide any mechanism for prioritizing certain types of traffic over others. This can result in delays or poor performance for time-critical applications, such as voice or video."
Advantages of Circuit Switching: It has the following advantages :
Disadvantages of Circuit Switching: It has the following disadvantages :
"Question on Circuit switching – These questions will help you understand circuit switching  Example 1 : How long it takes to send a file of ‘x bits’ from host A to host B over a circuit switched network that uses TDM with ‘h slots’ and have a bit rate of ‘R Mbps’, circuit establish time is k seconds.Find total time?"
Explanation : Transmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate / no. of slots = R/h bps Transmission time = size of file/ transmission rate = x / (R/h) = (x*h)/R
Total time = transmission time + circuit setup time = (x*h)/R secs + k secs  Example 2 : If a link transmits F frames/sec and each slot has B bits then find the transmission rate?
Explanation : Since it is not mention how many slots in each frame we take one frame has one slot. The transmission rate is the amount of data sent in 1 second. Transmission rate = F * B bits/sec

"Prerequisite – Difference between Unipolar, Polar and Bipolar Line Coding Schemes"
Manchester encoding is a synchronous clock encoding technique used by the physical layer of the Open System Interconnection [OSI] to encode the clock and data of a synchronous bit stream.  The idea of RZ and the idea of-L are combined in manchester
"Different encoding techniques are used in data communication to ensure data security and transmission speed. Manchester encoding is an example of digital encoding. Because each data bit length is defined by default, it differs from other digital encoding schemes. The bit state is defined by the direction of the transition. Bit status is represented in various ways by different systems, although most systems use 1 bit for low to high transitions and 0 bit for high to low transitions."
"In manchester duration of a bit is divided into two halves. The voltage remains the same at one level during the first half & moves to the other level.The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.Differential Manchester,on the other hand,combines the idea of RZ and NRZ-I. There is always a transition at the middle of the bit, but the bit values are determined at the beginning of the bit. if next bit is zero there is transition if next bit is 1 there is none."
The binary data to be transmitted over the cable are not sent as NRZ [Non-return-to-zero].
"Non-return-to-zero [NRZ] – NRZ code’s voltage level is constant during a bit interval. When there is a long sequence of 0s and 1s, there is a problem at the receiving end. The problem is that the synchronization is lost due to a lack of transmissions. It is of 2 types:"
Only drawback is the signal rate.The signal rate is manchester and differential is double that for NRZ. The reason is that there is always one transition at the middle of the bit and maybe one transition at the end of each bit.
"Self-clocking: Manchester encoding is self-clocking, which means that the receiver can synchronize its clock with the transmitter’s clock. This ensures that the data is transmitted and received at the same rate, and there is no need for a separate clock signal."
"Reduced DC component: Manchester encoding eliminates the DC component in the transmitted signal, which reduces the risk of errors due to interference from external sources."
"Error detection: Manchester encoding provides a mechanism for detecting errors in the transmitted data. Any change in the voltage level within a time interval indicates a bit error, which can be detected and corrected."
Simplicity: Manchester encoding is a relatively simple encoding scheme that can be implemented using simple digital circuits.
"Lower data rate: Manchester encoding has a lower data rate than other encoding schemes, such as non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding, which means that it takes more time to transmit the same amount of data."
"Higher bandwidth requirement: Manchester encoding requires a higher bandwidth than other encoding schemes, as each bit requires two voltage transitions within each time interval."
"Clock synchronization: Although Manchester encoding is self-clocking, it still requires the receiver to synchronize its clock with the transmitter’s clock, which can be a challenge in some situations."
"Reduced transmission distance: Manchester encoding has a reduced transmission distance compared to other encoding schemes, as the signal loses strength over long distances due to the need for frequent voltage transitions."
"Multiplexing is used in cases where the signals of lower bandwidth and the transmitting media is having higher bandwidth. In this case, the possibility of sending a number of signals is more. In this, the signals are combined into one and are sent over a link that has greater bandwidth of media than the communicating nodes."
"In this, a number of signals are transmitted at the same time, and each source transfers its signals in the allotted frequency range. There is a suitable frequency gap between the 2 adjacent signals to avoid over-lapping. Since the signals are transmitted in the allotted frequencies so this decreases the probability of collision. The frequency spectrum is divided into several logical channels, in which every user feels that they possess a particular bandwidth. A number of signals are sent simultaneously at the same time allocating separate frequency bands or channels to each signal. It is used in radio and TV transmission. Therefore to avoid interference between two successive channels Guard bands are used."
"This happens when the data transmission rate of media is greater than that of the source, and each signal is allotted a definite amount of time. These slots are so small that all transmissions appear to be parallel. In frequency division multiplexing all the signals operate at the same time with different frequencies, but in time-division multiplexing, all the signals operate with the same frequency at different times."
"The time slots are pre-assigned and fixed. This slot is even given if the source is not ready with data at this time. In this case, the slot is transmitted empty. It is used for multiplexing digitized voice streams."
"The slots are allocated dynamically depending on the speed of the source or their ready state. It dynamically allocates the time slots according to different input channels’ needs, thus saving the channel capacity."
"Efficient Use of Bandwidth: FDM allows multiple signals to be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can lead to more efficient use of available bandwidth.No Time Synchronization Required: FDM does not require precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it easier to implement.Low Implementation Cost: FDM is a relatively simple technique that does not require sophisticated hardware or software, making it less expensive to implement."
"Limited Capacity: FDM is limited in terms of the number of signals that can be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can be a disadvantage in applications where a large number of signals need to be transmitted.Interference: FDM can be susceptible to interference from other signals transmitted on nearby frequencies, which can degrade the quality of the transmitted signals.Difficulty in Assigning Frequencies: FDM requires careful assignment of frequencies to different signals to avoid interference, which can be a complex and time-consuming process."
"High Capacity: TDM can support a large number of signals over a single communication channel, making it ideal for applications where many signals need to be transmitted.Simple Implementation: TDM is a relatively simple technique that is easy to implement, making it a cost-effective solution for many applications.Precise Time Synchronization: TDM requires precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, which can help ensure accurate transmission of signals."
"Inefficient Use of Bandwidth: TDM may not make optimal use of available bandwidth, as time slots may be left unused if there are no signals to transmit during a particular time slot.High Implementation Cost: TDM requires sophisticated hardware or software to ensure precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it more expensive to implement than FDM.Vulnerable to Timing Jitter: TDM can be vulnerable to timing jitter, which can occur when the timing of the transmitting and receiving devices drifts out of sync, leading to errors in the transmission of signals."
"OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. OSI model was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization‘, in the year 1984."
"The OSI model, created in 1984 by ISO, is a reference framework that explains the process of transmitting data between computers. It is divided into seven layers that work together to carry out specialised network functions, allowing for a more systematic approach to networking."
The OSI model consists of seven abstraction layers arranged in a top-down order:
"The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together."
"The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of the DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:"
The packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of the NIC(Network Interface Card). DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.
The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the destination host will reply with its MAC address.
"The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer."
The transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.
"At the sender’s side: The transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Segmentation, and also implements Flow and error control to ensure proper data transmission. It also adds Source and Destination port numbers in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer."
1. Connection-Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process that includes
"In this type of transmission, the receiving device sends an acknowledgment, back to the source after a packet or group of packets is received. This type of transmission is reliable and secure."
"2. Connectionless service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer. In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a packet. This approach allows for much faster communication between devices. Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service."
"This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, and authentication, and also ensures security."
"Let us consider a scenario where a user wants to send a message through some Messenger application running in his browser. The “Messenger” here acts as the application layer which provides the user with an interface to create the data. This message or so-called Data is compressed, encrypted (if any secure data), and converted into bits (0’s and 1’s) so that it can be transmitted."
The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.
"At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user."
The main functions of the application layer are given below.
"When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender’s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver’s end."
"Step 1: Luffy interacts with e-mail application like Gmail, outlook, etc. Writes his email to send. (This happens in Layer 7: Application layer)"
Step 2: Mail application prepares for data transmission like encrypting data and formatting it for transmission. (This happens in Layer 6: Presentation Layer)
Step 3: There is a connection established between the sender and receiver on the internet. (This happens in Layer 5: Session Layer)
Step 4: Email data is broken into smaller segments. It adds sequence number and error-checking information to maintain the reliability of the information. (This happens in Layer 4: Transport Layer)
Step 5: Addressing of packets is done in order to find the best route for transfer. (This happens in Layer 3: Network Layer)
"Step 6: Data packets are encapsulated into frames, then MAC address is added for local devices and then it checks for error using error detection. (This happens in Layer 2: Data Link Layer)"
Step 7: Lastly Frames are transmitted in the form of electrical/ optical signals over a physical network medium like ethernet cable or WiFi.
"After the email reaches the receiver i.e. Zoro, the process will reverse and decrypt the e-mail content. At last, the email will be shown on Zoro’s email client."
OSI Model defines the communication of a computing system into 7 different layers. Advantages of OSI Model include:
Some key differences between the OSI model and the TCP/IP Model are:
"We have discussed about What is OSI model?, What are layers of OSI model, How data flows in the 7 layers of OSI model, and the differences between TCP/IP protocol and OSI protocol."
"A network is two or more devices connected through a link. A link is a communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another. Devices can be a computer, printer, or any other device that is capable to send and receive data. For visualization purposes, imagine any link as a line drawn between two points."
"For communication to occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time. There are two possible types of connections:"
Example: Point-to-Point connection between the remote control and Television for changing the channels.
"Choosing the right line configuration depends on the specific needs of the network, including factors such as the size of the network, the type of data being transmitted, the level of reliability required, and the available resources. Different line configurations can offer various advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal configuration will depend on the specific use case."
"Spatial Sharing: If several devices can share the link simultaneously, it’s called Spatially shared line configuration."
"Temporal (Time) Sharing: If users must take turns using the link, then it’s called Temporally shared or Time Shared Line configuration."
"A wireless local area network (LAN) node that provides internet connection and virtual private network (VPN) access from a given location for users of devices with wireless connectivity is a Hot Spot. Nowadays hot spots are common in airports, libraries, hotels, coffee shops, etc. A user can connect to a hot spot manually by checking the wireless connection options then selecting one of them and entering authentication information which is usually a simple password. The establishment that owns the Hot Spot determines the range of the wireless router whose radius generally is about 100 to 200 meters."
"Hot Spot 2.0 (HS 2.0), also called Wi-Fi Certified Passpoint is the new standard for public-access Wi-Fi. It enables seamless roaming among WiFi networks and between WiFi and cellular networks. Wi-Fi Alliance developed the HS 2.0. The Wireless Broadband Association enabled it to provide seamless hand-off of traffic without requiring additional user sign-on and authentication."
"The HS 2.0 specification is based on a set of protocols called 802.11u. These protocols facilitate cellular-like roaming, increased bandwidth, and service on demand for wireless-equipped devices in general. When an 802.11u-capable device is in range of at least one Wi-Fi network, the device automatically selects a network and connects to it if the authentication to the network is done once before. Network discovery, registration, provisioning, and access processes are automated so that the user does not have to go through them manually in order to connect and stay connected."
"Benefits of Hotspot 2.0 Networks: Hotspot 2.0 networks provide cellular-style roaming for Wi-Fi networks. When you move around the world, your device will connect you to available public hotspots automatically. There are a few benefits to this:"
"Hotspot 2.0 provides a more seamless and secure Wi-Fi experience for users, particularly in public spaces where multiple networks may be available."
CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Detection) is a media access control method that was widely used in Early Ethernet technology/LANs when there used to be shared Bus Topology and each node ( Computers) were connected By Coaxial Cables. Now a Days Ethernet is Full Duplex and Topology is either Star (connected via Switch or Router) or Point to Point ( Direct Connection). Hence CSMA/CD is not used but they are still supported though.
"Consider a scenario where there are ‘n’ stations on a link and all are waiting to transfer data through that channel. In this case, all ‘n’ stations would want to access the link/channel to transfer their own data. The problem arises when more than one station transmits the data at the moment. In this case, there will be collisions in the data from different stations."
CSMA/CD is one such technique where different stations that follow this protocol agree on some terms and collision detection measures for effective transmission. This protocol decides which station will transmit when so that data reaches the destination without corruption.
"Consider the above situation. Two stations, A & B. Propagation Time: Tp = 1 hr ( Signal takes 1 hr to go from A to B)"
"After the collision occurs, a collision signal is generated and sent to both A & B to inform the stations about the collision. Since the collision happened midway, the collision signal also takes 30 minutes to reach A & B."
"This collision signal is received by all the stations on that link. Then,"
"How to ensure that it is our station’s data that collided? For this, Transmission time (Tt) > Propagation Time (Tp) [Rough bound] This is because we want that before we transmit the last bit of our data from our station, we should at least be sure that some of the bits have already reached their destination. This ensures that the link is not busy and collisions will not occur. But, above is a loose bound. We have not taken the time taken by the collision signal to travel back to us. For this consider the worst-case scenario."
"This collision occurs just before the data reaches B. Now the collision signal takes 59:59 minutes again to reach A. Hence, A receives the collision information approximately after 2 hours, that is, after 2 * Tp."
This is the maximum collision time that a system can take to detect if the collision was of its own data.
What should be the minimum length of the packet to be transmitted?
Padding helps in cases where we do not have such long packets. We can pad extra characters to the end of our data to satisfy the above condition.
"Prerequisite – Basics of Wi-fi MAC layer provides functionality for several tasks like control medium access, can also offer support for roaming, authentication, and power conservation. The basic services provided by MAC are the mandatory asynchronous data service and optional time-bounded service. IEEE 802.11 defines two MAC sub-layers:-"
MAC Frame: The MAC layer frame consists of 9 fields. The following figure shows the basic structure of an IEEE 802.11 MAC data frame along with the content of the frame control field.
"Frame Control Field: The frame control field contains information about the type of frame, the data rate, and the power management status."
Duration Field: The duration field specifies the length of time that the channel will be occupied by the transmission.
Address Fields: The address fields specify the source and destination MAC addresses of the Wi-Fi devices involved in the communication.
Sequence Control Field: The sequence control field is used to identify and manage the transmission sequence of the frames.
"Frame Body: The frame body contains the actual data being transmitted between Wi-Fi devices, such as IP packets, TCP segments, or UDP datagrams."
Frame Check Sequence: The frame check sequence (FCS) is used to check the integrity of the data transmitted in the frame and to detect any transmission errors.
"Management, Control, and Data Frames: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame defines three types of frames: management frames, control frames, and data frames. Management frames are used for network management, control frames are used for coordination between Wi-Fi devices, and data frames are used for the transmission of actual data."
"Fragmentation: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame supports fragmentation, which allows large data packets to be divided into smaller fragments for transmission."
Acknowledgments: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame uses acknowledgments to confirm the successful transmission of frames and to request the retransmission of any frames that were not successfully received.
We take a close look at so-called WiFi which is also known as IEEE standard 802.11
"Consider the situation depicted in the figure, where each of the four nodes is able to send and receive signals that reach just the nodes to its immediate left and right. For example, B can exchange frames with A and C but it cannot reach D, while C can reach B and D but not A. (A and D’s reach is not shown in the figure.) Suppose both A and C want to communicate with B and so they each send it a frame. A and C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far. These two frames collide with each other at B, but unlike an Ethernet, neither A nor C is aware of this collision. A and C are said to be hidden nodes with respect to each other. According to Wikipedia, the hidden node problem can be defined as “In wireless networking, the hidden node problem or hidden terminal problem occurs when a node is visible to a wireless access point (AP), but not to other nodes communicating with that AP.”"
"This is because the nodes A and C are out of range of each other(and so cannot detect a collision while transmitting). Thus, Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) does not work, and collisions occur. The data received by the access point is corrupted due to the collision. To overcome the hidden node problem, RTS/CTS handshaking (IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS) is implemented in addition to the Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. A related problem, called the exposed node problem, occurs under the following stated circumstances: Suppose B is sending to A (as in the above Figure). Node C is aware of this communication because it hears B’s transmission. It would be a mistake for C to conclude that it cannot transmit to anyone just because it can hear B’s transmission. For example, suppose C wants to transmit to node D. This is not a problem since C’s transmission to D will not interfere with A’s ability to receive from B. We address these problems by an algorithm known as Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA). The sender and receiver exchange frames with each other before transmitting data. This informs all nearby nodes that a transmission is about to begin. Sender transmits Request to Send (RTS) frame to receiver. The receiver then replies with clear to send (CTS) frame back to the sender. Any node that receives CTS frame knows that it is close to the receiver, therefore, cannot transmit a frame. Any node that receives the RTS frame but not the CTS frame knows that is not close to the receiver to interfere with it, So it is free to transmit data. Reference – Wikipedia"
"Fairness: Collision avoidance protocols like CSMA/CA ensure that all devices have an equal opportunity to transmit data, regardless of their position in the network. This helps to ensure fairness in the network."
Switch ports are Layer 2 interfaces that are used to carry layer 2 traffic. A single switch port can carry single VLAN traffic. Frames are handled differently according to the type of link they are traversing.
Note: All switch ports are assigned VLAN 1 by default (VLAN 1 cannot be modified or deleted).
There are 2 different types of ports in a switched environment:
"These switch ports belong to carry the traffic of only one VLAN. By default, it will carry the traffic of native VLAN (VLAN 1) . If the switch ports are assigned as access ports then they can be considered as the switch ports belongs to a single broadcast domain. Any traffic arriving on these switch ports is considered as it belongs to the VLAN assigned to the port. Example:"
"Here is a simple topology in which 2 switches are connected and only the default VLAN (VLAN 1)is configured on both switches i.e all the switch ports of both switches belong to a single broadcast domain. 
Now, note that the link between the switches has to be configured as an access port because only a single VLAN (VLAN 1) data has to be exchanged. Now after assigning an IP address to PC1-192.168.1.1/24, PC2-192.168.1.2/24, PC3-192.168.1.3/24, PC3-192.168.1.4/24, the user shall configure the link between the 2 switches as an access port. 
Switch1(config)#interface fa0/0
Switch1(config-if)#switchport mode access
Here, there is no need to assign VLAN to the ports as all the switch ports on both switches are configured as VLAN 1 by default.
Advantages:

Access ports are used to connect end devices, such as PCs, printers, and servers, to the switch. These ports are simple to configure and provide a direct connection to the network. 
Access ports are typically configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN, which provides a layer of security by segregating traffic between different VLANs. 
Access ports are less complex than trunk ports, which makes them easier to configure and troubleshoot. 

Disadvantages:

Access ports can only carry traffic for a single VLAN, which can limit network flexibility and scalability. If a device needs to communicate with devices on another VLAN, it must go through a router or Layer 3 switch. 
Access ports are susceptible to VLAN hopping attacks, where an attacker can gain access to another VLAN by exploiting weaknesses in the network.

Trunk portsAccess Port:
These switch ports belong to and carry the traffic of more than one VLAN. This is a great advantage as to carry the traffic of a group of VLAN, a single switch port can be used. These are of great use if the user wants to exchange traffic between more than one switch having more than one VLAN configured. To identify traffic belongs to VLAN, the VLAN identification method (802.1q or ISL) is used. Also, to carry traffic between more than one VLAN, then inter VLAN routing is required, in which the link between router and switch is configured as trunk as the link has to carry the traffic of more than one VLAN (in case of a router on a stick configuration not in inter VLAN routing by layer 3 switches). 
Note: Trunk links can carry the traffic of different VLANs across them but by default, if the links between switches are not trunk then only information from the configured access VLAN will be exchanged. 
Example: 


Here is a simple topology in which 2 switches are connected and VLANs 2 and 3 are configured on both switches as shown. 
Note – A user has not assigned any VLANs to other ports of switches, therefore, the other ports will be in VLAN 1 by default. 
Now, note that the link between the switches has to be configured as a trunk port because here more than one VLAN (VLAN 1, 2, 3) frame has to be exchanged between the switches. Now assigning IP address to PC1-12.168.1.1/24, PC2-192.168.2.1/24, PC3-192.168.1.2/24, PC3-192.168.2.2/24. 
Now, the first user has to make VLANs on both switches. 
Switch1(config)#vlan 2
Switch1(config)#vlan 3

Switch2(config)#vlan 2
Switch2(config)#vlan 3
Now, a user has more than one VLAN configured on both switches. Therefore, users have to assign the VLANs to their respective ports on Switch1. 
Switch1(config)#interface fa0/1
Switch1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2
Switch1(config)#interface fa0/2
Switch1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 3
Now, configure VLANs on their respective ports on Switch2. 
Switch2(config-if)#interface fa0/1
Switch2(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2
Switch2(config)#interface fa0/2
Switch2(config-if)#switchport access vlan 3
Now, configure the link between 2 switches as a trunk port. 
Switch1#interface fa0/0
Switch1#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switch1#switchport mode trunk
As a result of this, now the user can carry more than one VLAN traffic from one switch to another switch (here, only configuration of switch ports are shown not the configuration of the router is shown. To perform inter VLAN routing, a configuration of the router is also needed).
 
Advantages:

Trunk ports are used to connect switches to each other, which allows for the creation of a larger, more flexible network. 
Trunk ports can carry traffic for multiple VLANs, which provides greater flexibility and scalability. This allows devices on different VLANs to communicate with each other without the need for a router or Layer 3 switch. 
Trunk ports provide a more efficient use of bandwidth by allowing multiple VLANs to share the same physical link. 

Disadvantages:

Trunk ports are more complex to configure than access ports, which can make them more difficult to troubleshoot. 
Trunk ports are more susceptible to security threats, such as VLAN hopping and misconfiguration, which can potentially compromise the entire network.

"Only the administrator should have complete access to the network while the other employees like junior network engineer need not full access to the network device. A junior-level engineer generally requires only to crosscheck the configuration of the device, not to add or delete any configuration so why should give full access to that employee? For these types of scenarios, the administrator defines access to the devices according to the roles of the user. Role-based Access Control – The concept of Role-based Access Control is to create a set of permissions and assign these permissions to a user or group. With the help of these permissions, only limited access to users can be provided therefore level of security is increased. There are different ways to perform RBAC such as creating custom privilege levels or creating views. Custom level privilege – When we take a console of the router, we enter into the user-level mode. The user-level mode has privilege level 1. By typing enable, we enter into a privileged mode where the privilege level is 15. A user with privilege level 15 can access all the commands that are at level 15 or below. By creating a custom privilege level (between 2 and 14) and assigning commands to it, the administrator can provide subset of commands to the user. Configuration – First we will add a command to our privilege level say 8 and assign a password to it."
"Here, we have assigned the password as saurabh. Also note that 0 here means the password followed is clear text (non-hashed) . Now, we will create a local user name saurabh and associated this user with configured level. Enable aaa model and assign default list to various lines."
"Now, whenever username Saurabh will take remote access through vty lines, he will be assigned privilege level 8. Creating views: Role-Based CLI access enables the administrator to create different views of the device for different users. Each view defines the commands that a user can access. It is similar to privilege levels. Role-based CLI provides 2 types of views:"
"Note – It is necessary to apply a password to any view before configuring it. Also, here instead of a secret password, enable password can be used but it is less secure as it is not encrypted. We can check the configuration by:"
"Advantages of Role-based Access ControlThere are different advantages to utilizing RBAC, including:"
"1.Working on functional proficiency:- With RBAC, organizations can diminish the requirement for administrative work and secret word changes when they recruit new representatives or switch the jobs of existing representatives. RBAC allows associations rapidly to add and change jobs, as well as carry out them across stages, working frameworks (OSes) and applications. It likewise eliminates the potential for blunder while allocating client consents. Also, with RBAC, organizations can all the more effectively incorporate outsider clients into their organizations by giving them predefined jobs."
"2.Upgrading consistence:- Each association should conform to nearby, state and government guidelines. Organizations for the most part really like to carry out RBAC frameworks to meet the administrative and legal necessities for secrecy and protection since leaders and IT offices can all the more actually oversee how the information is gotten to and utilized. This is especially significant for monetary establishments and medical organizations that oversee delicate information."
"3.Giving chairmen expanded perceivability:- RBAC gives network overseers and administrators greater perceivability and oversight into the business, while likewise ensuring approved clients and visitors on the framework are just given admittance to what they need to take care of their responsibilities.Lessening costs:- By not permitting client admittance to specific cycles and applications, organizations might ration or more expense successfully use assets, like organization data transmission, memory and capacity."
"4.Diminishing gamble of breaks and information spillage:- Executing RBAC implies confining admittance to delicate data, consequently lessening the potential for information breaks or information spillage."
"Prerequisite : Sliding Window Protocol – Set 1 (Sender Side), Set 2 (Receiver Side) Why Selective Repeat Protocol? The go-back-n protocol works well if errors are less, but if the line is poor it wastes a lot of bandwidth on retransmitted frames. An alternative strategy, the selective repeat protocol, is to allow the receiver to accept and buffer the frames following a damaged or lost one. Selective Repeat attempts to retransmit only those packets that are actually lost (due to errors) :"
"Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) : This protocol(SRP) is mostly identical to GBN protocol, except that buffers are used and the receiver, and the sender, each maintains a window of size. SRP works better when the link is very unreliable. Because in this case, retransmission tends to happen more frequently, selectively retransmitting frames is more efficient than retransmitting all of them. SRP also requires full-duplex link. backward acknowledgements are also in progress."
"Figure – the sender only retransmits frames, for which a NAK is receivedEfficiency of Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) is same as GO-Back-N’s efficiency :"
"if  Tt(ack) :Transmission delay for acknowledgment , Tq: Queuing delay and  Tpro: Processing delay is mention"

"Above formula is applicable for any condition, if any of the things are not given we assume it to be 0."
"VLANs are used to divide broadcast domain at layer 2. By default, all the switch ports are in VLAN 1. Configuration of VLANs other than VLAN 1 then to carry traffic of these VLANs, user has to make a switch port trunk which is connected to another switch. If the frame is forwarded out to an access link then it is considered that the frame belongs to the VLAN which is configured on that switch port. But if the frame is forwarded out to a trunk link then how did the other device know that the traffic belongs to which VLAN? There comes the concept of VLAN identification methods. VLAN Identification methods – If the frame is forwarded out to a trunk link then a header or tag is added to the frame header which specifies the VLAN to which the frame belongs. The frame is encapsulated at the sender’s switch and removed at the receiver’s switch and then forwarded out to the ports which belongs to that VLAN (according to the processing of switch). There are 2 VLAN identification methods:"
Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet or token ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.
"In order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of standby power, much less than normal operating power. Disabling wake-on-LAN when not needed can therefore vary slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket."
"Magic Packet Structure The magic packet is a broadcast frame containing anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer’s 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes. Since the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it may be sent as any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a UDP datagram to port 0, 7, or 9, or directly over Ethernet as EtherType 0x0842."
The Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be very simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface card with minimal power requirement. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer the MAC address is required and makes IP addresses and DNS names meaningless.
"As early as 1924, an AT&T engineer, Henry Nyquist, realized that even a perfect channel has a finite transmission capacity. He derived an equation expressing the maximum data rate for a finite-bandwidth noiseless channel. In 1948, Claude Shannon carried Nyquist’s work further and extended to it the case of a channel subject to random(that is, thermodynamic) noise (Shannon, 1948). This paper is the most important paper in all of the information theory."
"Data rate governs the speed of data transmission. A very important consideration in data communication is how fast we can send data, in bits per second, over a channel. Data rate depends upon 3 factors:"
"Two theoretical formulas were developed to calculate the data rate: one by Nyquist for a noiseless channel, another by Shannon for a noisy channel."
"1. Noiseless Channel: Nyquist Bit Rate: For a noiseless channel, the Nyquist bit rate formula defines the theoretical maximum bit rate Nyquist proved that if an arbitrary signal has been run through a low-pass filter of bandwidth, the filtered signal can be completely reconstructed by making only 2*Bandwidth (exact) samples per second. Sampling the line faster than 2*Bandwidth times per second is pointless because the higher-frequency components that such sampling could recover have already been filtered out. If the signal consists of L discrete levels, Nyquist’s theorem states:"
"In the above equation, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, L is the number of signal levels used to represent data, and BitRate is the bit rate in bits per second. Bandwidth is a fixed quantity, so it cannot be changed. Hence, the data rate is directly proportional to the number of signal levels."
"2. Noisy Channel Shannon Capacity: In reality, we cannot have a noiseless channel; the channel is always noisy. Shannon capacity is used, to determine the theoretical highest data rate for a noisy channel:"
"In the above equation, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, and capacity is the capacity of the channel in bits per second.  Bandwidth is a fixed quantity, so it cannot be changed. Hence, the channel capacity is directly proportional to the power of the signal, as SNR = (Power of signal) / (power of noise)."
The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is usually expressed in decibels (dB) given by the formula:
So for example a signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 is commonly expressed as:
"The maximum data rate, also known as the channel capacity, is the theoretical limit of the amount of information that can be transmitted over a communication channel. The maximum data rate for noiseless and noisy channels can be calculated using Shannon’s theorem."
"Advances in digital signal processing and error correction techniques have allowed for the development of more sophisticated modulation and encoding schemes that can increase the maximum data rate of noisy channels. However, these techniques can also increase the complexity and cost of the communication system."
"Noiseless channels have a higher maximum data rate and provide error-free transmission. However, they are not realistic as most channels have some degree of noise. Noisy channels have a lower maximum data rate but are more realistic, and techniques like error correction can be used to improve transmission reliability. The choice of channel type depends on the specific needs of the communication system."
"A local Area Network (LAN) is a data communication network connecting various terminals or computers within a building or limited geographical area. The connection between the devices could be wired or wireless. Ethernet, Token rings, and Wireless LAN using IEEE 802.11 are examples of standard LAN technologies."
"Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology and is defined under IEEE standards 802.3. The reason behind its wide usability is that Ethernet is easy to understand, implement, and maintain, and allows low-cost network implementation. Also, Ethernet offers flexibility in terms of the topologies that are allowed. Ethernet generally uses a bus topology. Ethernet operates in two layers of the OSI model, the physical layer and the data link layer. For Ethernet, the protocol data unit is a frame since we mainly deal with DLLs. In order to handle collisions, the Access control mechanism used in Ethernet is CSMA/CD."
"Although Ethernet has been largely replaced by wireless networks, wired networking still uses Ethernet more frequently. Wi-Fi eliminates the need for cables by enabling users to connect their smartphones or laptops to a network wirelessly. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard offers faster maximum data transfer rates when compared to Gigabit Ethernet. However, wired connections are more secure and less susceptible to interference than wireless networks. This is the main justification for why so many companies and organizations continue to use Ethernet."
"Robert Metcalfe’s invention of Ethernet in 1973 completely changed computer networking. With Ethernet Version 2’s support for 10 Mbps and an initial data rate of 2.94 Mbps, it first gained popularity in 1982. Ethernet’s adoption was accelerated by the IEEE 802.3 standardization in 1983. Local area networks (LANs) and the internet were able to expand quickly thanks to the rapid evolution and advancement of Ethernet, which over time reached speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and higher. It evolved into the standard technology for wired network connections, enabling dependable and quick data transmission for private residences, commercial buildings, and data centers all over the world."
There are different types of Ethernet networks that are used to connect devices and transfer data.
"1. Fast Ethernet: This type of Ethernet network uses cables called twisted pair or CAT5. It can transfer data at a speed of around 100 Mbps (megabits per second). Fast Ethernet uses both fiber optic and twisted pair cables to enable communication. There are three categories of Fast Ethernet: 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, and 100BASE-T4."
"2. Gigabit Ethernet: This is an upgrade from Fast Ethernet and is more common nowadays. It can transfer data at a speed of 1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps (gigabit per second). Gigabit Ethernet also uses fiber optic and twisted pair cables for communication. It often uses advanced cables like CAT5e, which can transfer data at a speed of 10 Gbps."
"3.10-Gigabit Ethernet: This is an advanced and high-speed network that can transmit data at a speed of 10 gigabits per second. It uses special cables like CAT6a or CAT7 twisted-pair cables and fiber optic cables. With the help of fiber optic cables, this network can cover longer distances, up to around 10,000 meters."
"4. Switch Ethernet: This type of network involves using switches or hubs to improve network performance. Each workstation in this network has its own dedicated connection, which improves the speed and efficiency of data transfer. Switch Ethernet supports a wide range of speeds, from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, depending on the version of Ethernet being used."
"In summary, Fast Ethernet is the basic version with a speed of 100 Mbps, Gigabit Ethernet is faster with a speed of 1 Gbps, 10-Gigabit Ethernet is even faster with a speed of 10 Gbps, and Switch Ethernet uses switches or hubs to enhance network performance."
"Using Manchester encoding, data can be transmitted over a physical medium in communication systems. It is a type of line coding where the signal transitions, as opposed to the absolute voltage levels, serve as the data representation."
"Each bit of information is split into two equal time periods, or “halves,” in Manchester encoding. If the signal level is higher during the first half of the bit period than it is during the second, the result is a logic high (typically 1), or vice versa."
"Since we are talking about IEEE 802.3 standard Ethernet, therefore, 0 is expressed by a high-to-low transition, a 1 by the low-to-high transition. In both Manchester Encoding and Differential Manchester, the Encoding Baud rate is double of bit rate."
"Speed: When compared to a wireless connection, Ethernet provides significantly more speed. Because Ethernet is a one-to-one connection, this is the case. As a result, speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) or even 100 Gigabits per second (Gbps) are possible."
"Efficiency: An Ethernet cable, such as Cat6, consumes less electricity, even less than a wifi connection. As a result, these ethernet cables are thought to be the most energy-efficient."
"Good data transfer quality: Because it is resistant to noise, the information transferred is of high quality."
"Ethernet LANs consist of network nodes and interconnecting media, or links."
"Data Terminal Equipment (DTE): Media, Generally, DTEs are the end devices that convert the user information into signals or reconvert the received signals. DTE devices are: personal computers, workstations, file servers or print servers also referred to as end stations. These devices are either the source or the destination of data frames. The data terminal equipment may be a single piece of equipment or multiple pieces of equipment that are interconnected and perform all the required functions to allow the user to communicate. A user can interact with DTE or DTE may be a user."
"Data Communication Equipment (DCE):- DCEs are the intermediate network devices that receive and forward frames across the network. They may be either standalone devices such as repeaters, network switches, or routers, or maybe communications interface units such as interface cards and modems. The DCE performs functions such as signal conversion, coding, and maybe a part of the DTE or intermediate equipment."
"Distance limitations: Ethernet has distance limitations, with the maximum cable length for a standard Ethernet network being 100 meters. This means that it may not be suitable for larger networks that require longer distances."
"Bandwidth sharing: Ethernet networks share bandwidth among all connected devices, which can result in reduced network speeds as the number of devices increases."
"Security vulnerabilities: Although Ethernet includes built-in security features, it is still vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access and data interception."
"Complexity: Ethernet networks can be complex to set up and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and expertise."
"Compatibility issues: While Ethernet is generally interoperable with other networking technologies, compatibility issues can arise when integrating with older or legacy systems."
"Cable installation: Ethernet networks require the installation of physical cables, which can be time-consuming and expensive to install."
"Physical limitations: Ethernet networks require physical connections between devices, which can limit mobility and flexibility in network design."
The Aloha protocol was designed as part of a project at the University of Hawaii. It provided data transmission between computers on several of the Hawaiian Islands using packet radio networks. Aloha is a multiple access protocol at the data link layer and proposes how multiple terminals can access the medium without interference or collision.
"Pure Aloha is an un-slotted, decentralized, and simple-to-implement protocol. In pure Aloha, the stations simply transmit frames whenever they want data to send. It does not check whether the channel is busy or not before transmitting. In the event that two or more stations transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs and frames are destroyed. Whenever any station transmits a frame, it expects acknowledgment from the receiver. If it is not received within a specified time, the station assumes that the frame or acknowledgment has been destroyed. Then, the station waits for a random amount of time and sends the frame again. This randomness helps in avoiding more collisions. This scheme works well in small networks where the load is not much. But in largely loaded networks, this scheme fails poorly. This led to the development of Slotted Aloha. To assure pure aloha: Its throughput and rate of transmission of the frame are to be predicted. For that, let’s make some assumptions:"
"This is quite similar to Pure Aloha, differing only in the way transmissions take place. Instead of transmitting right at the demand time, the sender waits for some time. In slotted ALOHA, the time of the shared channel is divided into discrete intervals called Slots. The stations are eligible to send a frame only at the beginning of the slot and only one frame per slot is sent. If any station is not able to place the frame onto the channel at the beginning of the slot, it has to wait until the beginning of the next time slot. There is still a possibility of collision if two stations try to send at the beginning of the same time slot. But still, the number of collisions that can possibly take place is reduced by a large margin and the performance becomes much well compared to Pure Aloha."
"Collision is possible only in the current slot. Therefore, Vulnerable Time is Tt."
"In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the Ethernet is located in the lower layers and facilitates the operation of the physical and data link layers. The OSI model consists of seven layers, which are as follows."
"The topmost layer, known as the application layer, is what enables users to download and access data from email clients or web browsers. With the aid of the application, users enter their queries, and the request is then sent to the following layer, which is known as a “packet.” The packet contains data about the sender and the destination web address. The packet is transmitted from the application layer until it reaches the bottom layer, also known as the Ethernet frame."
The cast term here signifies some data(stream of packets) is being transmitted to the recipient(s) from the client(s) side over the communication channel that helps them to communicate. Let’s see some of the “cast” concepts that are prevailing in the computer networks field.
"This type of information transfer is useful when there is a participation of a single sender and a single recipient. So, in short, you can term it a one-to-one transmission. For example, if a device having IP address 10.1.2.0 in a network wants to send the traffic stream(data packets) to the device with IP address 20.12.4.2 in the other network, then unicast comes into the picture. This is the most common form of data transfer over networks."
Broadcasting transfer (one-to-all) techniques can be classified into two types:
"Limited Broadcasting: Suppose you have to send a stream of packets to all the devices over the network that your reside, this broadcasting comes in handy. For this to achieve, it will append 255.255.255.255 (all the 32 bits of IP address set to 1) called Limited Broadcast Address in the destination address of the datagram (packet) header which is reserved for information transfer to all the recipients from a single client (sender) over the network."
"Direct Broadcasting: This is useful when a device in one network wants to transfer packet stream to all the devices over the other network. This is achieved by translating all the Host ID part bits of the destination address to 1, referred to as Direct Broadcast Address in the datagram header for information transfer."
This mode is mainly utilized by television networks for video and audio distribution. One important protocol of this class in Computer Networks is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used for resolving an IP address into a physical address which is necessary for underlying communication.
"In multicasting, one/more senders and one/more recipients participate in data transfer traffic. In this method traffic recline between the boundaries of unicast (one-to-one) and broadcast (one-to-all). Multicast lets servers direct single copies of data streams that are then simulated and routed to hosts that request it. IP multicast requires the support of some other protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), Multicast routing for its work. Also in Classful IP addressing Class D is reserved for multicast groups."
Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. It is highly recommended that you practice them.
"Prerequisite – Network Devices, Switch functions at layer 2, Difference between layer-2 and layer-3 switches"
Switches are the connectivity points of an Ethernet network. These are small devices that can receive data from multiple input ports and send it to the specific output port that takes data to its intended destination in the network. There are different types of switches in a network. These are:
Unmanaged switches: These are the switches that are mostly used in home networks and small businesses as they plug in and instantly start doing their job and such switches do not need to be watched or configured. These require only small cable connections. It allows devices on a network to connect with each other such as a computer to a computer or a computer to a printer in one location. They are the least expensive switches among all categories.
"Managed switches: These types of switches have many features like the highest levels of security, precision control, and full management of the network. These are used in organizations containing a large network and can be customized to enhance the functionality of a certain network. These are the most costly option but their scalability makes them an ideal option for a network that is growing. They are achieved by setting a simple network management protocol(SNMP)."
(I) Smart switches: These switches offer basic management features with the ability to create some levels of security but have a simpler management interface than the other managed switches. Thus they are often called partially managed switches. These are mostly used in fast and constant LANs which support gigabit data transfer and allocations. It can accept the configuration of VLANs (Virtual LAN).
"(II) Enterprise-managed switches: They have features like the ability to fix, copy, transform and display different network configurations, along with a web interface SNMP agent and command-line interface. These are also known as fully managed switches and are more expensive than smart switches as they have more features that can be enhanced. These are used in organizations that contain a large number of ports, switches, and nodes."
"There are several types of switches used in computer networking, including:"
"In Computer Network ,there are various ways through which different components are connected to one another. Network Topology is the way that defines the structure, and how these components are connected to each other."
The arrangement of a network that comprises nodes and connecting lines via sender and receiver is referred to as Network Topology. The various network topologies are:
"Point-to-Point Topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth."
"In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. In Mesh Topology, the protocols used are AHCP (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocols), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), etc."
Figure 1: Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels. These channels are known as links.
"A common example of mesh topology is the internet backbone, where various internet service providers are connected to each other via dedicated channels. This topology is also used in military communication systems and aircraft navigation systems."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology."
"In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node. The hub can be passive in nature i.e., not an intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices, at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as an active hub. Active hubs have repeaters in them. Coaxial cables or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers. In Star Topology, many popular Ethernet LAN protocols are used as CD(Collision Detection), CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), etc."
Figure 2: A star topology having four systems connected to a single point of connection i.e. hub.
A common example of star topology is a local area network (LAN) in an office where all computers are connected to a central hub. This topology is also used in wireless networks where all devices are connected to a wireless access point.
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology."
"Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes. In Bus Topology, various MAC (Media Access Control) protocols are followed by LAN ethernet connections like TDMA, Pure Aloha, CDMA, Slotted Aloha, etc."
Figure 3: A bus topology with shared backbone cable. The nodes are connected to the channel via drop lines.
"A common example of bus topology is the Ethernet LAN, where all devices are connected to a single coaxial cable or twisted pair cable. This topology is also used in cable television networks. For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology."
"In a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network."
"The data flows in one direction, i.e. it is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology. In-Ring Topology, the Token Ring Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data."
Figure 4: A ring topology comprises 4 stations connected with each forming a ring.
The most common access method of ring topology is token passing.
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology."
"This topology is the variation of the Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data. In Tree Topology, protocols like DHCP and SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration ) are used."
"Figure 5: In this, the various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater. This data flow from top to bottom i.e. from the central hub to the secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e. devices to the secondary hub and then to the central hub. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes."
"A common example of a tree topology is the hierarchy in a large organization. At the top of the tree is the CEO, who is connected to the different departments or divisions (child nodes) of the company. Each department has its own hierarchy, with managers overseeing different teams (grandchild nodes). The team members (leaf nodes) are at the bottom of the hierarchy, connected to their respective managers and departments."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology."
This topological technology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above. Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form. It means these can be individuals such as Ring or Star topology or can be a combination of various types of topologies seen above. Each individual topology uses the protocol that has been discussed earlier.
Figure 6: The above figure shows the structure of the Hybrid topology. As seen it contains a combination of all different types of networks.
"A common example of a hybrid topology is a university campus network. The network may have a backbone of a star topology, with each building connected to the backbone through a switch or router. Within each building, there may be a bus or ring topology connecting the different rooms and offices. The wireless access points also create a mesh topology for wireless devices. This hybrid topology allows for efficient communication between different buildings while providing flexibility and redundancy within each building."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology."
"Prerequisites – Stop & Wait, Go Back N, Selective Repeat"
Before starting with the questions a quick recap for all the protocols. Stop and wait –
"Computer networks that provide connection-oriented services are called Virtual Circuits while those providing connection-less services are called Datagram networks. For prior knowledge, the Internet that we use is based on a Datagram network (connection-less) at the network level as all packets from a source to a destination do not follow the same path."
"1. Permanent Virtual Circuits(PVC): The communication management station, which is the telco’s central office, manually configures the switches, which offer performance comparable to dedicated lines. The main use for these always-on circuits is high-speed communication. PVCs require telco resources (switches) to be allocated to a single communication circuit whether or not that circuit is in use, making them an expensive solution for wide-area networks (WANs)."
"2. Switched Virtual circuits (SVCs): As soon as a communication session is established, the switches are set up. SVCs are released at the conclusion of the session and can be used to create new channels of communication. This is the process of normal phone communication. SVCs, which are billed on a per-minute basis, are generally utilised in WANs when backups to dedicated leased lines are required."
Trunk ports are ports that are used to carry the traffic of more than one VLAN. The port which connects two different switches and the switches have more than one VLAN configured then that port should be made trunk. If all the VLANs are allowed then trunk ports will carry traffic of all the VLANs including native VLANs for which the traffic goes untagged otherwise only the allowed VLANs traffic will be carried by the trunk link. The trunk link traffic would be encapsulated or tagged either by ISL or 802.1Q.
"By default, all switch ports are access ports therefore to make a port trunk, the user should manually make it trunk by using DTP."
"Dynamic Trunking Protocol – Dynamic Trunking Protocol is CISCO proprietary protocol used for negotiating a trunk link between two switches as well as the encapsulation type of either 802.1q or ISL (Generally, 802.1q is used because ISL has more overhead than 802.1q). Of course, It is a layer 2 (data link) protocol and is enabled by default."
Here are the different options available while configuring a switch interface:-
switchport mode access (DTP mode OFF) – This mode puts the switch interface into permanent non-trunking mode regardless of whether the neighbouring interface is a trunk port or trying to become a trunk port that is why it is known as DTP mode OFF. The port is a dedicated layer 2 access port.
switchport mode trunk (DTP mode ON) – It puts the interface into trunking mode. The interface will become a trunk interface even if the neighbouring ports are trunk or not that is why it is called DTP mode ON.
"switchport mode dynamic auto – This is a default mode on the older CISCO switches. This mode makes the interface able to convert to a trunk link. The interface will become a trunk link if the neighbouring interface is set to trunk or desirable mode. If both switches interface mode is auto, then the trunk will not be formed."
"switchport mode dynamic desirable – By this mode, the interface will actively attempt to convert the link into a trunk link. The interface will become a trunk port if the neighbouring interface is set to trunk, desirable or auto."
switchport nonegotiate – This mode prevents the interface from generating DTP frames. This command is used only when the switch port mode is access or trunk. You must manually configure the neighbouring interface as a trunk interface to establish a trunk link.
"Now, let’s see the scenarios in which the switch interface will either become a trunk or access interface."
"By observing this, it is clear that whenever you receive a DTP packet that requests to form a trunk, your interface will be in trunk mode."
"Prerequisite – Virtual LAN (VLAN) Virtual LAN (VLAN) is used to break a broadcast domain into smaller domain at layer 2. Only (all) hosts belonging to same VLAN are able to communicate with each other while communicating with other VLAN hosts, Inter Vlan routing is done. But in same VLAN, if we want some hosts should not be able to communicate with other hosts (in the same VLAN) at layer 2 level then VLAN access-list or concept of private VLAN is used. Private VLAN – Private VLAN are used to break the layer 2 broadcast domain into small subdomains. A subdomain consists of one primary VLAN and one or more secondary VLAN."
Note – VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) should be operating in mode transparent or off in order to configure private VLANs. Configuration –
"Here is a topology in which Router1 (IP address- 192.168.1.1/24), PC1(IP address- 192.168.1.10/24 ), PC2(IP address- 192.168.1.20/24 ), PC3 (IP address- 192.168.1.30/24) and switch are connected to each other as shown in the figure. In this task, we will assign VLAN 10 to fa0/1, fa0/2, and VLAN 20 to fa0/3 and fa0/0 as VLAN 100. Then, we will make VLAN 10 as community VLAN, VLAN 20 as isolated VLAN and VLAN 100 as primary VLAN. Configuring Private VLAN on switch:"
"Here, we have created VLAN 10 and configured it as community VLAN. Now, configuring isolated VLAN."
"Now, creating vlan 100 and configuring it as primary VLAN and associating secondary vlan 10, 20 to it."
"Now, configuring ports as private-vlan host port and associating them with primary and secondary VLAN. First configuring fa0/1 and fa0/2 and associating vlan 10 (secondary VLAN) with its primary VLAN (vlan 100)."
"Now, configuring fa0/3 and associating vlan 20 (secondary VLAN) with its primary VLAN (vlan 100)."
"Now, at last we will configure interface fa0/0 as promiscuous port and associate the port with primary vlan (vlan 100) and secondary VLAN (vlan 10, 20)."
We can verify the ports associated with secondary VLANs by command.
If you want to verify the primary VLAN and secondary VLAN (Isolated or Community) then use the command.
"1.Isolation of gadgets: Private VLANs can be utilized to separate gadgets inside a VLAN from one another. For instance, in a common facilitating climate, you can utilize a Private VLAN to seclude the virtual servers from one another, keeping them from conveying straightforwardly."
"2.Security: Private VLANs can be utilized to upgrade security by keeping specific gadgets from speaking with different gadgets inside a similar VLAN. For instance, you can utilize a Private VLAN to disengage an organization portion containing delicate data from the remainder of the organization."
"3.Simplified organization the executives: Private VLANs can be utilized to work on network the board by decreasing the quantity of VLANs required. Rather than making separate VLANs for each gathering of gadgets, you can utilize a solitary VLAN with various Private VLANs."
"4.Compliance: Private VLANs can assist with meeting consistence prerequisites by secluding traffic containing touchy data or frameworks. For instance, Installment Card Industry (PCI) consistence expects that Visa information be detached from other traffic, which can be accomplished utilizing Private VLANs."
"A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network. A directory, in the most generic sense, is a comprehensive listing of objects. A phone book is a type of directory that stores information about people, businesses, and government organizations. Phone books typically record names, addresses, and phone numbers. Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on a network. It is a primary feature of Windows Server, an operating system that runs both local and Internet-based servers."
"Directory Service – A directory service is a hierarchical arrangement of objects which are structured in a way that makes access easy. However, functioning as a locator service is not AD’s exclusive purpose. It also helps organizations have a central administration over all the activities carried out in their networks. Essentially a Network Directory Service:"
"Active Directory provides several different services, which fall under the umbrella of “Active Directory Domain Services, ” or AD DS. These services include:"
"Domain Controllers – A server that is running AD DS is called a domain controller.Domain controllers host and replicate the directory service database inside the forest. The directory service also provides services for managing and authenticating resources in the forest.These servers host essential services in AD DS, including the following: – Kerberos Key Distribution Center (kdc) – NetLogon (Netlogon) – Windows Time (W32time) – Intersite Messaging (IsmServ) Active Directory Objects:"
"Centralized management: AD DS provides centralized management of users, computers, and other network resources, which makes it easier to manage and secure large-scale networks."
"Scalability: AD DS can support large-scale networks with tens of thousands of users and devices, making it suitable for enterprise-level organizations."
"Group policy management: AD DS provides group policy management, which allows administrators to manage and configure settings for groups of users and computers."
"Authentication and authorization: AD DS provides authentication and authorization services, which allows administrators to control access to network resources based on user roles and permissions."
"Single sign-on: AD DS supports single sign-on (SSO), which allows users to log in once and access multiple network resources without having to provide credentials multiple times."
"Complexity: AD DS can be complex to set up and manage, requiring specialized knowledge and expertise."
"Cost: AD DS requires licensing fees and may require additional hardware resources, which can increase the cost of network infrastructure."
"Vulnerability: AD DS can be vulnerable to security threats, such as password attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can compromise network security."
Compatibility: AD DS is designed for Windows networks and may not be compatible with other operating systems or network environments.
"Maintenance: AD DS requires regular maintenance, including software updates and security patches, to ensure optimal performance and security."
"We’ve been studying a lot about the Wired Network. Ethernet is the most common example. Wired networks differ from wireless which uses radio waves rather than transmitting electrical signals over the cables. Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the internet via WLAN network and a wireless access point abbreviated as AP. Every WLAN has an access point which is responsible for receiving and transmitting data from/to users. IEEE has defined certain specifications for wireless LAN, called IEEE 802.11 which covers physical and data link layers. Access Point(AP) is a wireless LAN base station that can connect one or many wireless devices simultaneously to internet.   The architecture of this standard has 2 kinds of services: 1. BSS (Basic Service Set) 2. ESS (Extended Service Set)   BSS is the basic building block of WLAN. It is made of wireless mobile stations and an optional central base station called Access Point. Stations can form a network without an AP and can agree to be a part of a BSS. A BSS without an AP cannot send data to other BSSs and defines a standalone network. It is called Ad-hoc network or Independent BSS(IBSS).i.e A BSS without AP is an ad-hoc network. A BSS with AP is infrastructure network. The figure below depicts an IBSS, BSS with the green coloured box depicting an AP.  ESS is made up of 2 or more BSSs with APs. BSSs are connected to the distribution system via their APs. The distribution system can be any IEEE LAN such as Ethernet.   ESS has 2 kinds of stations: 1. Mobile – stations inside the BSS 2. Stationary – AP stations that are part of wired LAN.  The topmost green box represents the distribution system and the other 2 green boxes represent the APs of 2 BSSs."
"Wireless Connectivity: Wi-Fi allows devices to connect to a network without the use of physical cables, providing greater mobility and flexibility."
"High Speed: Wi-Fi networks can provide high-speed internet access, allowing users to download and upload data quickly."
"Easy Setup: Wi-Fi networks are easy to set up and configure, requiring minimal technical knowledge. Most modern devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity built-in."
"Multiple Device Connectivity: Wi-Fi networks can support multiple devices at the same time, allowing multiple users to connect to the same network and access the internet simultaneously."
"Security: Wi-Fi networks can be secured using encryption and other security measures, which protect against unauthorized access and hacking."
"Range: Wi-Fi networks can cover a wide range of distances, depending on the type of router and the environment in which it is used."
"Compatibility: Wi-Fi is a widely adopted technology and is compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and smart home devices."
"Interference: Wi-Fi signals can be subject to interference from other wireless devices and physical barriers, such as walls and buildings, which can impact network performance."
"Reliability: Wi-Fi networks can sometimes suffer from dropouts or signal loss, particularly in areas with high network congestion or interference."
"Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a concept in which we can divide the devices logically on layer 2 (data link layer). Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but the broadcast domain can be divided by switches using the concept of VLAN."
"A broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the devices in the same broadcast domain will receive it. The devices in the same broadcast domain will receive all the broadcast packets but it is limited to switches only as routers don’t forward out the broadcast packet. To forward out the packets to different VLAN (from one VLAN to another) or broadcast domains, inter Vlan routing is needed. Through VLAN, different small-size sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle."
Configuration – We can simply create VLANs by simply assigning the vlan-id and Vlan name.
"Here, 2 is the Vlan I’d and accounts is the Vlan name. Now, we assign Vlan to the switch ports.e.g-"
"By this, switchport fa0/0, fa0/1, fa0-2 will be assigned Vlan 2."
"Assigning IP address 192.168.1.1/24, 192.168.1.2/24 and 192.168.2.1/24 to the PC’s. Now, we will create Vlan 2 and 3 on switch."
We have made VLANs but the most important part is to assign switch ports to the VLANs.
"As seen, we have assigned Vlan 2 to fa0/0, fa0/2, and Vlan 3 to fa0/1."
"There are three ways to connect devices on a VLAN, the type of connections are based on the connected devices i.e. whether they are VLAN-aware(A device that understands VLAN formats and VLAN membership) or VLAN-unaware(A device that doesn’t understand VLAN format and VLAN membership)."
Virtual LANs (VLANs) are widely used in cloud computing environments to improve network performance and security. Here are a few examples of real-time applications of VLANs:
"The Stop and Wait ARQ offers error and flow control but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgment even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection), you can’t use this full speed due to limitations of stop and wait."
Sliding Window protocol handles this efficiency issue by sending more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number. The idea is the same as pipelining in architecture.
Transmission Delay (Tt) – Time to transmit the packet from the host to the outgoing link. If B is the Bandwidth of the link and D is the Data Size to transmit
Propagation Delay (Tp) – It is the time taken by the first bit transferred by the host onto the outgoing link to reach the destination. It depends on the distance d and the wave propagation speed s (depends on the characteristics of the medium).
"Efficiency – It is defined as the ratio of total useful time to the total cycle time of a packet. For stop and wait protocol,"
"Since acknowledgements are very less in size, their transmission delay can be neglected."
Effective Bandwidth(EB) or Throughput – Number of bits sent per second.
"Capacity of link – If a channel is Full Duplex, then bits can be transferred in both the directions and without any collisions. Number of bits a channel/Link can hold at maximum is its capacity."
"In Stop and Wait protocol, only 1 packet is transmitted onto the link and then sender waits for acknowledgement from the receiver. The problem in this setup is that efficiency is very less as we are not filling the channel with more packets after 1st packet has been put onto the link. Within the total cycle time of Tt + 2*Tp units, we will now calculate the maximum number of packets that sender can transmit on the link before getting an acknowledgement."
"Maximum packets That can be Transmitted in total cycle time = 1+2*a Let me explain now with the help of an example. Consider Tt = 1ms, Tp = 1.5ms. In the picture given below, after sender has transmitted packet 0, it will immediately transmit packets 1, 2, 3. Acknowledgement for 0 will arrive after 2*1.5 = 3ms. In Stop and Wait, in time 1 + 2*1.5 = 4ms, we were transferring one packet only. Here we keep a window of packets that we have transmitted but not yet acknowledged.  After we have received the Ack for packet 0, window slides and the next packet can be assigned sequence number 0. We reuse the sequence numbers which we have acknowledged so that header size can be kept minimum as shown in the diagram given below."
"All the packets in the current window will be given a sequence number. Number of bits required to represent the sender window = ceil(log2(1+2*a)). But sometimes number of bits in the protocol headers is pre-defined. Size of sequence number field in header will also determine the maximum number of packets that we can send in total cycle time. If N is the size of sequence number field in the header in bits, then we can have 2N sequence numbers. Window Size ws = min(1+2*a, 2N) If you want to calculate minimum bits required to represent sequence numbers/sender window, it will be ceil(log2(ws)). In this article, we have discussed sending window only. For receiving window, there are 2 protocols namely Go Back N and Selective Repeat which are used to implement pipelining practically. We will be discussing receiving window in set 2."
There are two types of Sliding Window Protocol which include Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ:
"Go-Back-N ARQ allows sending more than one frame before getting the first frame’s acknowledgment. It is also known as sliding window protocol since it makes use of the sliding window notion. There is a limit to the amount of frames that can be sent, and they are numbered consecutively. All frames beginning with that frame are retransmitted if the acknowledgment is not received in a timely manner. For more detail visit the page Go-Back-N ARQ."
"Additionally, this protocol allows additional frames to be sent before the first frame’s acknowledgment is received. But in this case, the excellent frames are received and buffered, and only the incorrect or lost frames are retransmitted. Check the detailed explanation of Selective Repeat ARQ."
"Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit, is established between two devices before data transmission begins. The circuit remains dedicated to the communication for the duration of the session, and no other devices can use it while the session is in progress. Circuit switching is commonly used in voice communication and some types of data communication."
"Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network. Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, as well as other information needed for routing. The packets may take different paths to reach their destination, and they may be transmitted out of order or delayed due to network congestion."
"In conclusion, circuit switching and packet switching are two different methods used in communication networks to transfer data between two or more devices. Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path before data transmission begins, while packet switching divides the data into smaller units called packets and transmits them over the network. Understanding the differences between the two methods can help you choose the right network technology for your specific needs."
"VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a concept in which we divide the broadcast domain into smaller broadcast domains logically at layer 2. If we create different VLANs then by default, a host from one VLAN can communicate with all the hosts residing in the same VLAN. If we want some hosts not able to reach other hosts within the same VLAN, then the concept of VLAN Access-list or Private VLAN can be used. (Access-list, is a set of various permit or deny conditions, used for packet filtering)"
"VLAN ACL is used to filter traffic of a VLAN (traffic within a VLAN i.e traffic for destination host residing in the same VLAN). All packets entering the VLAN are checked against the VACL. Unlike Router ACL, VACL is not defined in a direction but it is possible to filter traffic based on the direction of the traffic by combining VACLs and Private VLAN features."
"1. Security: VACLs can be utilized to control admittance to explicit VLANs, forestalling unapproved admittance to delicate organization assets. For instance, you can utilize a VACL to impede all traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, with the exception of approved clients."
"2. Filtering: VACLs can be utilized to channel traffic in view of explicit models, for example, IP address or port number. This can assist with decreasing organization clog by restricting how much undesirable traffic on the organization."
"3. Monitoring: VACLs can be utilized to screen network traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, giving perceivability into network movement. For instance, you can utilize a VACL to log all traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, making it conceivable to recognize potential security dangers or investigate network issues."
"4. QoS: VACLs can be utilized to focus on network traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, guaranteeing that basic traffic gets the important data transfer capacity and diminishing the probability of blockage."
"There is a switch named switch1 which is connected to 3 routers named Router1 (IP address-192.168.1.1/24), Router2 (IP address-192.168.1.2/24), and Router3 (IP address-192.168.1.3/24) as shown in the figure."
"In this task, we will deny traffic from Router1 to Router3 using VACL."
Configuring access-list on switch1 stating that all IP traffic should be allowed from host 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3
"Now, configuring the VLAN access-map which states that match the IP address defined in access-list and take action of drop (which means traffic should not be allowed from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3)."
"In the first command, 10 is the sequence number of the access map. If we do not define any sequence number then it will automatically take 10 as a sequence number. Now, for the traffic from Router1 (192.168.1.1) to Router3 (192.168.1.3), the traffic will be dropped but what about the traffic from Router2 to Router3?"
"The traffic from Router2 to Router3 will also get drop because no action is defined for this traffic (implicit deny). Therefore, we have to define another rule stating that the other traffic should be allowed."
"In the first command, 20 is the sequence number which means this rule will be checked after the first rule having sequence number 10."
"At last, we will assign this access-map, named My_access_list, to a VLAN (here VLAN 1)"
"This command will display the access map. This will display the name of the access-map, sequence number of the rule, and the access-list name (that has been used)."
This will display the VLANs which are filtered by the VLAN access map.
"Need for Byte-Stuffing
In variable-size framing at the data link layer, we need to define a way to separate one frame from the next. Byte stuffing is employed to accomplish the task. In byte stuffing an 8-bit flag (‘F’) is added at the beginning and at the end of the frame, thereby distinguishing one frame from the next. Therefore, every time a flag sequence (‘F’) is encountered, it signifies the beginning or end of a frame. This, ingenious scheme, however would give rise to a discrepancy, if the flag pattern (‘F’) would occur within the data carried by the frame itself. Byte stuffing comes to the rescue here, by stuffing the original data with an extra 8-bit escape sequence (‘E’) before the flag pattern, whenever it occurred within the data carried by a frame. The receiver would then have to de-stuff the escape sequence, in order to obtain the original data."
"A simple question that might arise at this juncture is, what if the escape sequence (‘E’) formed a part of the data to be sent! This scenario is handled in exactly the same way as described above, i.e an extra 8-bit escape sequence (‘E’) is added to the original data before the escape sequence that formed part of the data."
"In character-oriented protocols, where data to be carried are 8-bit characters, byte stuffing is employed to handle the problems discussed above."
"To make things simpler we will consider only three types of byte sequences in the sent data, as :
F : Flag Sequence
E : Escape Sequence
D : Any other Data Sequence"
From the above example we can see how the original data is recovered at the receiver end.
Bridge is a local internetworking device that is used to connect two or more network segments together. A bridge operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses the MAC addresses of devices to make forwarding decisions.
"Bridges were first introduced in the 1980s as a way to connect Ethernet segments together and extend the reach of a network. They were initially used to overcome the distance limitations of Ethernet networks, allowing multiple segments to be connected together to form a larger network."
Bridges work by examining the MAC addresses of devices on each network segment and forwarding packets only to the segment where the destination device is located. This helps to reduce network congestion and improve performance by limiting unnecessary traffic.
"Bridges can also be used to create separate collision domains, which helps to improve network performance by reducing collisions on the network. Collisions occur when two devices transmit data at the same time, causing a data collision that requires the data to be re-transmitted."
"Bridges can be used to connect different types of network segments, including Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI. They can also be used to connect wireless networks to wired networks, providing a way to extend the range and coverage of a wireless network."
"Overall, bridges are an important networking device that provides a way to connect multiple network segments together, improving network performance and extending the reach of a network."
"Local Internetworking is one which is within the same organization i.e. same building or same campus, then for the networking, we may not require the full power of the router. We can do it with a data link layer device called a bridge."
"Bridges: Bridges are a data link layer device and can connect to different networks as well as connect different networks of different types. Bridges from 802.x to 802.y where x & y may both be ethernet or one can be ethernet and other may be a token ring, etc. It locally connects small LANs, whereas if LANs are big then bridges can no longer handle them. Bridge follows a protocol in IEEE format execute 802.1 which is a spanning tree of bridges."
"In the above figure, there are four LANs that are connected by two bridges. Bridge 1 has two ports, one connecting to LAN 1 other connecting to LAN 2, Bridge 2 has three connecting to LAN 2, LAN 3, and LAN 4. So, A can communicate with H through two bridges."
"What if the host is moved to another segment or a new host is connected to a segment? If a new host is connected then the learning process of bridges is going to be a continuous process. Suppose if we move from LAN 1 to LAN 2 some machine, i.e. MAC address moves from LAN 1 to LAN 2, which means table entries should leave after some time so that the data remains fresh and relevant."
"Bridges Spanning Tree: For increased reliability, it is desirable to have redundant, alternative paths from source to destination, and with multiple paths, cycles result- bridges may multiply and forward frame forever without the frames being dropped. The solution is to organize bridges in a spanning tree by disabling a subset of interfaces."
"Improved Network Performance: Bridges can improve network performance by reducing network congestion and improving data transmission speeds, resulting in faster network speeds and reduced latency."
"Better Network Security: Bridges can help to improve network security by creating logical isolation between different network segments, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of network attacks."
"Flexible Network Design: Bridges allow for flexible network design by enabling the connection of different network technologies and types, including Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, among others."
"Easy to Install and Configure: Bridges are relatively easy to install and configure, requiring minimal configuration and maintenance, making them an ideal solution for small to medium-sized networks."
"Limited Scalability: Bridges may not be scalable in larger networks, as the number of devices and network segments increases, which can lead to network congestion and performance degradation."
"Single Point of Failure: Bridges can be a single point of failure in the network, and if they fail, it can cause network downtime until the bridge is replaced."
"Limited Functionality: Bridges have limited functionality compared to other network devices, such as routers and switches, and may not be suitable for all network configurations and requirements."
"Higher Cost: Bridges can be more expensive compared to other network devices, such as hubs, which can make them less cost-effective for smaller networks."
The computer network is defined as a set of interconnected autonomous systems that facilitate distributed processing of information. It results in better performance with a high speed of processing. Computer Networks can be defined as collections of two or more computer networks that are linked together.
Some of the applications of Computer Networking are discussed below:
Some of the main advantages of Computer Networking are discussed below:
Some of the main disadvantages of Computer Networking are discussed below:
"There are 12 types of Computer Networks, which are listed below:"
"For more, you can refer to Types of Computer Networking."
"A Cellular device today has become unthinkingly an extension of our anthropological arms that has endowed us with an added means of communication, which we term as wireless communication or mobile telecommunication."
"A few millimeters sized SIM card plugged into a mobile device forms a worldwide used network technology called the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). What we tend to view as an ornamental handset and a few sprung out antennas with scattered cell towers is part of a complex architecture that fits into our daily requirement. This GSM system can be dissected into three main subsystems: Radio subsystem, Network subsystem, and Operation subsystem."
Lets discuss this hierarchical system breakdown to get a brief overview of how telecom providers are engaged in providing the freedom of speech to mobile users all over.
"1. Radio Subsystem –
As we all know mobile communication occurs in the form of radio waves that travel through the medium-air.The radio subsystem includes two main components. These include a mobile station (MS) and the Base Station System (BSS)."
"The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people to communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. It was created in the 1960s by the US Department of Defense as a way to connect computers and share information between researchers and scientists."
"The World Wide Web, or simply the web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources, linked together by hyperlinks and URLs. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a way for scientists to share information more easily. The web quickly grew to become the most popular way to access information on the internet."
"Together, the internet and the web have revolutionized the way we communicate, do business, and access information. They have made it possible for people all over the world to connect with each other instantly and have transformed many industries, from media and entertainment to education and healthcare."
"1. The Internet: In simplest terms, the Internet is a global network comprised of smaller networks that are interconnected using standardized communication protocols. The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite. This model divides methods into a layered system of protocols."
"The Internet provides a variety of information and communication facilities; contains forums, databases, email, hypertext, etc. It consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies."
"2. The World Wide Web: The Web is the only way to access information through the Internet. It’s a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language”, which supports a number of features including links and multimedia. These documents are interlinked using hypertext links and are accessible via the Internet."
"URI: URI stands for ‘Uniform Resource Identifier’. A URI can be a name, locator, or both for an online resource whereas a URL is just the locator. URLs are a subset of URIs.  A URL is a human-readable text that was designed to replace the numbers (IP addresses) that computers use to communicate with servers."
"A URL consists of a protocol, domain name, and path (which includes the specific subfolder structure where a page is located) like-"
"The Internet is not governed and has no single authority figure. The ultimate authority for where the Internet is going rests with the Internet Society, or ISOC. ISOC is a voluntary membership organization whose purpose is to promote global information exchange through Internet technology."
"In data communication terminology, a transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:"
1. Guided Media: It is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media. Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links. Features:
"(i) Twisted Pair Cable – It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely used Transmission Media. Twisted Pair is of two types:"
⇢ Better performance at a higher data rate in comparison to UTP
"The shielded twisted pair type of cable is most frequently used in extremely cold climates, where the additional layer of outer covering makes it perfect for withstanding such temperatures or for shielding the interior components."
(ii) Coaxial Cable – It has an outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges). Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.
"Radio frequency signals are sent over coaxial wire. It can be used for cable television signal distribution, digital audio (S/PDIF), computer network connections (like Ethernet), and feedlines that connect radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas."
(iii) Optical Fiber Cable – It uses the concept of refraction of light through a core made up of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding. It is used for the transmission of large volumes of data.
"The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode."
Stripline is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) transmission line medium invented by Robert M. Barrett of the Air Force Cambridge Research Centre in the 1950s. Stripline is the earliest form of the planar transmission line. It uses a conducting material to transmit high-frequency waves it is also called a waveguide. This conducting material is sandwiched between two layers of the ground plane which are usually shorted to provide EMI immunity.
"In this, the conducting material is separated from the ground plane by a layer of dielectric."
2. Unguided Media: It is also referred to as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media. No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals.
There are 3 types of Signals transmitted through unguided media:
(i) Radio waves – These are easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings. The sending and receiving antennas need not be aligned. Frequency Range:3KHz – 1GHz. AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission.
(ii) Microwaves – It is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna. Frequency Range:1GHz – 300GHz. These are majorly used for mobile phone communication and television distribution.
"(iii) Infrared – Infrared waves are used for very short distance communication. They cannot penetrate through obstacles. This prevents interference between systems. Frequency Range:300GHz – 400THz. It is used in TV remotes, wireless mouse, keyboard, printer, etc."
"The Network allows computers to connect and communicate with different computers via any medium. LAN, MAN, and WAN are the three major types of networks designed to operate over the area they cover. There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them. One of the major differences is the geographical area they cover, i.e. LAN covers the smallest area, MAN covers an area larger than LAN and WAN comprises the largest of all. There are other types of Computer Networks also, like :"
"PAN is a personal area network having an interconnection of personal technology devices to communicate over a short distance. It covers only less than 10 meters or 33 feet of area. PAN has fewer users as compared to other networks such as LAN, WAN, etc. PAN typically uses some form of wireless technology. PAN involves the transmission of data between information devices such as smartphones, personal computers, tablet computers, etc."
"LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. Private addresses are unique in relation to other computers on the local network. Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN."
"Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked is limited. By definition, the connections must be high-speed and relatively inexpensive hardware (Such as hubs, network adapters, and Ethernet cables). LANs cover a smaller geographical area (Size is limited to a few kilometres) and are privately owned. One can use it for an office building, home, hospital, school, etc. LAN is easy to design and maintain. A Communication medium used for LAN has twisted-pair cables and coaxial cables. It covers a short distance, and so the error and noise are minimized."
"Early LANs had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps. Propagation delay is very short in a LAN. The smallest LAN may only use two computers, while larger LANs can accommodate thousands of computers. LAN has a range up to 2km. A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN. The fault tolerance of a LAN is more and there is less congestion in this network. For example A bunch of students playing Counter-Strike in the same room (without internet)."
MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that covered by a LAN and a smaller area as compared to WAN. MAN has a range of 5-50km. It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same or different cities. It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an ISP (Internet Service Provider). MAN is designed for customers who need high-speed connectivity. Speeds of MAN range in terms of Mbps. It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.
The fault tolerance of a MAN is less and also there is more congestion in the network. It is costly and may or may not be owned by a single organization. The data transfer rate and the propagation delay of MAN are moderate. Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are Modem and Wire/Cable. Examples of a MAN are part of the telephone company network that can provide a high-speed DSL line to the customer or the cable TV network in a city.
"WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. WAN has a range of above 50 km. A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive."
"There are two types of WAN: Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN. WAN is difficult to design and maintain. Similar to a MAN, the fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network. A Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN or Satellite Link. Due to long-distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN."
"WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed since it involves increased distance and increased number of servers and terminals etc. The speed of WAN ranges from a few kilobits per second (Kbps) to megabits per second (Mbps). Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here. Devices used for the transmission of data through WAN are Optic wires, Microwaves, and Satellites. An example of a Switched WAN is the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network and Point-to-Point WAN is a dial-up line that connects a home computer to the Internet."
"Packet Switching in computer networks is a method of transferring data to a network in the form of packets. In order to transfer the file fast and efficiently manner over the network and minimize the transmission latency, the data is broken into small pieces of variable length, called Packet. At the destination, all these small parts (packets) have to be reassembled, belonging to the same file. A packet is composed of a payload and various control information. No pre-setup or reservation of resources is needed."
"Packet Switching uses the Store and Forward technique while switching the packets; while forwarding the packet each hop first stores that packet then forwards. This technique is very beneficial because packets may get discarded at any hop for some reason. More than one path is possible between a pair of sources and destinations. Each packet contains the Source and destination address using which they independently travel through the network. In other words, packets belonging to the same file may or may not travel through the same path. If there is congestion at some path, packets are allowed to choose different paths possible over an existing network."
"In packet switching the data is divided into small packets which allow faster movement of data. Each packet contains two parts that is Header and Payload, the header on each packet conation information. Below is the diagram of how packet switching works."
"Before starting the transmission, it establishes a logical path or virtual connection using a signaling protocol, between sender and receiver and all packets belongs to this flow will follow this predefined route. Virtual Circuit ID is provided by switches/routers to uniquely identify this virtual connection. Data is divided into small units and all these small units are appended with help of sequence numbers. Packets arrive in order at the destination. Overall, three phases take place here- The setup, data transfer and tear-down phases."
"All address information is only transferred during the setup phase. Once the route to a destination is discovered, entry is added to the switching table of each intermediate node. During data transfer, packet header (local header) may contain information such as length, timestamp, sequence number, etc."
"Connection-oriented switching is very useful in switched WAN. Some popular protocols which use the Virtual Circuit Switching approach are X.25, Frame-Relay, ATM, and MPLS(Multi-Protocol Label Switching)."
"Unlike Connection-oriented packet switching, In Connectionless Packet Switching each packet contains all necessary addressing information such as source address, destination address, port numbers, etc. Packets belonging to one flow may take different routes because routing decisions are made dynamically, so the packets that arrived at the destination might be out of order. It has no connection setup and teardown phase, like Virtual Circuits. Packet delivery is not guaranteed in connectionless packet switching, so reliable delivery must be provided by end systems using additional protocols."
To send a packet from A to B there are delays since this is a Store and Forward network.
"The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer systems that enables communication and the sharing of information across the world. The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and conduct business."
"Web programming refers to the development of web applications and websites that are accessed over the Internet. Web programming involves creating web pages, web applications, and other online content that can be displayed in a web browser."
"Web programming is accomplished using a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on the needs of the project."
"Web programming involves creating dynamic websites that are interactive and user-friendly. This includes the use of databases, server-side scripting, and client-side scripting to create applications that can process data, display content, and interact with users."
"The Internet is a vast network of computers, and servers, which communicate with each other. The internet connects the whole wide world together. The Internet is a vast network that connects billions of computers and other electronic devices all around the world. You can get nearly any information, communicate with anyone on the globe, and do a lot more with the Internet. All of this is possible by connecting a computer to the Internet, generally known as going online. When someone says a computer is online, they are simply referring to the fact that it is linked to the Internet. How does it actually work at a very low level?"
"Client-side: First, when we type a URL like www.google.com, the browser converts it into a file containing:"
"Now this file is converted to binary code by the browser and it is sent down the wires if we are connected through Ethernet and if we are using WiFi, first it converts it to a radio signal which is decoded by a router in a very low level. It is converted to binary and then sent to the servers."
This information or ‘binary codes’ go to the destination and respond if it is received by the sender only because of the IP address.
One router will send the information to another and this keeps on going until the binary codes reach the destination.
Server-side: Now the server receives the binary code and decodes it and sends the response in the following manner:
"Now, this is converted back to binary by the server and sent to the IP address that is requesting it. Once the codes are received by the client, the browser again decodes the information in the following way:"
To understand the basic web terminology refer: The Internet and the Web
The Internet and web programming have a wide range of uses and applications. Here are some of the most common uses:
"Web programming plays a crucial role in enabling many of these applications. Web programming is used to create websites, online stores, web applications, and other online services that are accessed through the Internet. Web programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python are used to create these web-based applications."
Some of the most significant issues in Internet and web programming:
"To communicate or transfer data from one computer to another, we need an address. In computer networks, various types of addresses are introduced; each works at a different layer. A MAC address, which stands for Media Access Control Address, is a physical address that works at the Data Link Layer. In this article, we will discuss addressing a DLL, which is the MAC Address."
"So, go through the article if you are eager to learn what is MAC address and its components."
"MAC Addresses are unique 48-bit hardware numbers of a computer that are embedded into a network card (known as a Network Interface Card) during manufacturing. The MAC Address is also known as the Physical Address of a network device. In the IEEE 802 standard, the data link layer is divided into two sublayers:"
The MAC address is used by the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data-Link Layer. MAC Address is worldwide unique since millions of network devices exist and we need to uniquely identify each.
"To understand what is MAC address is, it is very important that first you understand the format of the MAC Address. So a MAC Address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (6-bit binary number), which is mostly represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation."
"The First 6 digits (say 00:40:96) of the MAC Address identify the manufacturer, called the OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). IEEE Registration Authority Committee assigns these MAC prefixes to its registered vendors."
"The rightmost six digits represent Network Interface Controller, which is assigned by the manufacturer."
"As discussed above, the MAC address is represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation. But this is just a conversion, not mandatory. MAC address can be represented using any of the following formats:"
Note: Colon-Hexadecimal notation is used by Linux OS and Period-separated Hexadecimal notation is used by Cisco Systems.
"1. Unicast: A Unicast-addressed frame is only sent out to the interface leading to a specific NIC. If the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to zero, the frame is meant to reach only one receiving NIC. The MAC Address of the source machine is always Unicast."
"2. Multicast: The multicast address allows the source to send a frame to a group of devices. In Layer-2 (Ethernet) Multicast address, the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to one. IEEE has allocated the address block 01-80-C2-xx-xx-xx (01-80-C2-00-00-00 to 01-80-C2-FF-FF-FF) for group addresses for use by standard protocols."
"3. Broadcast: Similar to Network Layer, Broadcast is also possible on the underlying layer( Data Link Layer). Ethernet frames with ones in all bits of the destination address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) are referred to as the broadcast addresses. Frames that are destined with MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF will reach every computer belonging to that LAN segment."
"The reason for having both IP and MAC addresses lies in the way the Internet works, specifically in the structure of the OSI Model. This model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is sent and received over a network. It’s divided into seven layers, each performing specific functions."
"Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) uses a MAC (Media Access Control) address. These are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer. The primary function of MAC addresses is to manage how data is transported from one network node to another on a direct, physical basis – this is also referred to as “hop to hop” delivery."
"On the other hand, Layer 3 ( Network Layer ) uses an IP (Internet Protocol) address. These IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network and to route traffic between networks. The IP addresses ensure that the data gets from its original source reaches its final destination and it is also called “end-to-end” delivery of data."
"When a computer sends data, it first wraps it in an IP header, which includes the source and destination IP addresses. This IP header, along with the data, is then encapsulated in a MAC header, which includes the source and destination MAC addresses for the current “hop” in the path."
"As the data travels from one router to the next, the MAC address header is stripped off and a new one is generated for the next hop. However, the IP header, which was generated by the original computer, remains intact until it reaches the final destination. This process illustrates how the IP header manages the “end to end” delivery, while the MAC headers handle the “hop to hop” delivery."
"So, Both IP and MAC addresses are essential for the functioning of the Internet. While MAC addresses facilitate the direct, physical transfer of data between network nodes, IP addresses ensure that the data reaches its final destination."
"Consider a LAN (Local Area Network) as a large gathering where everyone is engaged in conversations. Now, let’s suppose that there are two individuals at this gathering who coincidentally share the same name. This scenario would inevitably create confusion, right? If someone calls out that name, both individuals would respond, making it challenging to discern the intended recipient of the message."
"In a similar manner, within a network, each device possesses a distinct identifier referred to as a MAC (Media Access Control) address. Think of it as a unique name assigned to the device. When information is transmitted across the network, it is directed to a specific MAC address, much like a letter being addressed to a specific individual."
"However, if multiple devices within the same network were to have identical MAC addresses, it would result in confusion and disrupt the network’s functioning. The network would struggle to ascertain which device should receive the transmitted information. To prevent this confusion and ensure the accurate delivery of information, it is vital for each device on a network to possess a unique MAC address."
"A MAC address is mostly used to configure a router for a network device or during troubleshooting.  The address of our computer device can be easily checked with any operating device. All the Apple devices connected to our home network contain a unique MAC address. Manufacturers may identify a MAC address by other names, such as the physical address, hardware ID, wireless ID, and Wi-Fi address."
Following are the steps which help to find MAC addresses for different OS
Here is the Step-by-Step guide to finding MAC addresses on Windows.
Step 1 – Press Window Start or Click on Windows Key.
"Step 2 – In the search box, type cmd, and the command prompt will get open."
"Step 3 – Click on cmd,  the command prompt window will display,"
Step 4 – In the command prompt type ipconfig/all command and then press enter.
"Step 5 – As you will scroll down, each physical address is the MAC address of your device."
Here is a step-by-step guide to finding MAC addresses on a Mac operating system.
"Step 2 – In the system settings, click on the MAC network option."
Here is a step-by-step guide to finding MAC addresses on a Unix/Linux operating system.
"Some ISPs use MAC addresses to assign an IP address to the gateway device. When a device connects to the ISP, the DHCP server records the MAC address and then assigns an IP address. Now the system will be identified through the MAC address. When the device gets disconnected, it loses the IP address."
"If the user wants to reconnect, the DHCP server checks if the device is connected before. If so, then the server tries to assign the same IP address (in case the lease period has not expired). In case the user changed the router, the user has to inform the ISP about the new MAC address because the new MAC address is unknown to ISP, so the connection cannot be established."
"Or the other option is Cloning, user can simply clone the registered MAC address with ISP. Now router keeps reporting the old MAC addresses to ISP and there will be no connection issue."
The Media Access Control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to most network adapters or network interface cards (NICs) by the manufacturer for identification and use in the Media Access Control protocol sub-layer.
An Ethernet MAC address is a 48-bit binary value expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (4 bits per hexadecimal digit). MAC addresses are in a flat structure and thus they are not routable on the Internet. Serial interfaces do not use MAC addresses. It does NOT contain a network and host portion with the address. It is used to deliver the frame to the destination device.
"Prerequisite – Basics of CSMA/ CD, Collision Detection in CSMA/CD"
"Back-off algorithm is a collision resolution mechanism which is used in random access MAC protocols (CSMA/CD). This algorithm is generally used in Ethernet to schedule re-transmissions after collisions. If a collision takes place between 2 stations, they may restart transmission as soon as they can after the collision. This will always lead to another collision and form an infinite loop of collisions leading to a deadlock. To prevent such scenario back-off algorithm is used. Let us consider a scenario of 2 stations A and B transmitting some data:"
"After a collision, time is divided into discrete slots (Tslot) whose length is equal to 2t, where t is the maximum propagation delay in the network. The stations involved in the collision randomly pick an integer from the set K i.e {0, 1}. This set is called the contention window. If the sources collide again because they picked the same integer, the contention window size is doubled and it becomes {0, 1, 2, 3}. Now the sources involved in the second collision randomly pick an integer from the set {0, 1, 2, 3} and wait for that number of time slots before trying again. Before they try to transmit, they listen to the channel and transmit only if the channel is idle. This causes the source which picked the smallest integer in the contention window to succeed in transmitting its frame. So, the Back-off algorithm defines a waiting time for the stations involved in collision, i.e. for how much time the station should wait to re-transmit."
"Example – Case-1 : Suppose 2 stations A and B start transmitting data (Packet 1) at the same time then, collision occurs. So, the collision number n for both their data (Packet 1) = 1. Now, both the station randomly pick an integer from the set K i.e. {0, 1}."
"Case-2: Assume that A wins in Case 1 and transmitted its data(Packet 1). Now, as soon as B transmits its packet 1, A transmits its packet 2. Hence, collision occurs. Now collision no. n becomes 1 for packet 2 of A and becomes 2 for packet 1 of B. For packet 2 of A, K = {0, 1} For packet 1 of B, K = {0, 1, 2, 3}"
"So, the probability of collision decreases as compared to Case 1."
"When a collision occurs, the transmitting device waits for a random amount of time before retransmitting the packet. The random delay helps to prevent multiple devices from retransmitting their packets simultaneously and causing another collision."
"The random delay time is determined using an exponential back-off algorithm. The delay time starts at a minimum value and doubles after each collision, up to a maximum value. The maximum delay time is usually set to 1024 slot times, where a slot time is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of the network segment to the other."
"The back-off algorithm is implemented in hardware on the network interface card (NIC) of each device. When a collision is detected, the NIC generates a random number between 0 and 2^n-1, where n is the number of collisions that have occurred. The NIC then multiplies the random number by the slot time to determine the delay time before retransmitting."
"If the maximum number of retransmissions is reached without successful transmission, the device gives up and reports a transmission error."
"Reliable data transfers are one of the primary concerns in computer networking. This service department lies in the hands of TCP. Their major flow control protocols – Stop and Wait, Go Back N, and Selective Repeat."
Hamming code is a set of error-correction codes that can be used to detect and correct the errors that can occur when the data is moved or stored from the sender to the receiver. It is a technique developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction.
Redundant bits are extra binary bits that are generated and added to the information-carrying bits of data transfer to ensure that no bits were lost during the data transfer. The number of redundant bits can be calculated using the following formula:
"Suppose the number of data bits is 7, then the number of redundant bits can be calculated using: = 2^4 ≥ 7 + 4 + 1 .Thus, the number of redundant bits= 4"
A parity bit is a bit appended to a data of binary bits to ensure that the total number of 1’s in the data is even or odd. Parity bits are used for error detection. There are two types of parity bits:
Hamming Code is simply the use of extra parity bits to allow the identification of an error.
A redundancy bits are placed at positions that correspond to the power of 2. As in the above example:
"Suppose in the above example the 6th bit is changed from 0 to 1 during data transmission, then it gives new parity values in the binary number:"
For all the parity bits we will check the number of 1’s in their respective bit positions.
Error Detection and Correction: Hamming code is designed to detect and correct single-bit errors that may occur during the transmission of data. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender.
Redundancy: Hamming code uses redundant bits to add additional information to the data being transmitted. This redundancy allows the recipient to detect and correct errors that may have occurred during transmission.
Efficiency: Hamming code is a relatively simple and efficient error-correction technique that does not require a lot of computational resources. This makes it ideal for use in low-power and low-bandwidth communication networks.
"Widely Used: Hamming code is a widely used error-correction technique and is used in a variety of applications, including telecommunications, computer networks, and data storage systems."
"Single Error Correction: Hamming code is capable of correcting a single-bit error, which makes it ideal for use in applications where errors are likely to occur due to external factors such as electromagnetic interference."
"Limited Multiple Error Correction: Hamming code can only correct a limited number of multiple errors. In applications where multiple errors are likely to occur, more advanced error-correction techniques may be required."
Which one of the following choices gives the correct values of x and y ?
"We will first insert our codeword according to hamming code d8d7d6d5c4d4d3d2c3d1c2c1,"
"Now,calculating hamming code according to first parity bit  C1: d7d5d4d2d1c1. 1×0010, To make number of 1 even , for this x must be 0."
"Similarly, lets calculate for y , we will start from c8 and make its even=>110xy here x is already 0 , so y should be 0."
So the value of x is 0 and y is 0.

Propagation Delay = (Distance between routers) / (Velocity of propagation)
Rule 1) Send one data packet at a time. Rule 2) Send the next packet only after receiving acknowledgement for the previous.
Rule 1) Send acknowledgement after receiving and consuming a data packet. Rule 2) After consuming packet acknowledgement need to be sent (Flow Control)
"3. Delayed Acknowledgement/Data: After a timeout on the sender side, a long-delayed acknowledgement might be wrongly considered as acknowledgement of some other recent packet."
The above 3 problems are resolved by Stop and Wait for ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) that does both error control and flow control.
3. Delayed Acknowledgement: This is resolved by introducing sequence numbers for acknowledgement also.
"1) Sender A sends a data frame or packet with sequence number 0. 2) Receiver B, after receiving the data frame, sends an acknowledgement with sequence number 1 (the sequence number of the next expected data frame or packet) There is only a one-bit sequence number that implies that both sender and receiver have a buffer for one frame or packet only."
"Stop and Wait ARQ has very less efficiency , it can be improved by increasing the window size. Also , for better efficiency , Go back N and Selective Repeat Protocols are used."
"The Stop and Wait ARQ solves the main three problems but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgement even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection). To solve this problem, we can send more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number. We will be discussing these protocols in the next articles."
So Stop and Wait ARQ may work fine where propagation delay is very less for example LAN connections but performs badly for distant connections like satellite connections.
Transmission mode means transferring data between two devices. It is also known as a communication mode. Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected.
"1. Simplex Mode –In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction. Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output."
"2. Half-Duplex Mode –In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction. Example: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions."
"3. Full-Duplex Mode –In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways:"
"Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions. Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time."
"An access network is a type of network which physically connects an end system to the immediate router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system. Examples of access networks are ISP, home networks, enterprise networks, ADSL, mobile network, FTTH etc."
"A crucial element of contemporary telecommunications technology are mainly access networks. They make quick data transfer and dependable, affordable communication possible. Businesses can also benefit from access networks’ secure voice and video conferencing services over short- and long-distances, high-speed data transfers, and other features. Access networks’ capacity to handle a lot of traffic at once lowers the expenses associated with long-distance communications. Additionally, they make it simpler for companies to use satellite or fibre optic links to reach a global audience and access a variety of online services."
"At first, Before they may connect to an ISP, they must have a modem, router, or switch. Through a variety of network protocols, this device connects to the ISP’s server and activates the connection. Users can select from a range of connection technologies, such as DSL, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or 5G, depending on their location and type of equipment also."
"The data is delivered across numerous linked devices in an access network using internal routing protocols like Internet Protocol (IP). This eliminates the need for external switches or routers by enabling direct communication between all devices connected to the same network. Additionally, access networks include features like quality of service (QoS), which prioritise traffic according to importance and so help networks run better."
"Token Ring protocol is a communication protocol used in Local Area Network (LAN). In a token ring protocol, the topology of the network is used to define the order in which stations send. The stations are connected to one another in a single ring. It uses a special three-byte frame called a “token” that travels around a ring. It makes use of Token Passing controlled access mechanism. Frames are also transmitted in the direction of the token. This way they will circulate around the ring and reach the station which is the destination."
Ring Latency – The time taken by a single bit to travel around the ring is known as ring latency.
"Where, d = length of the ring v = velocity of data in ring N = no. of stations in ring b = time taken by each station to hold the bit before transmitting it (bit delay)"
Cycle Time – The time taken by the token to complete one revolution of the ring is known as cycle time.
"Token Holding Time (THT) – The maximum time a token frame can be held by a station is known as THT, by default it is set to 10msec. No station can hold the token beyond THT."
"Station 1: Receives the token and transmits data D1 and then, releases the token. Station 2: Receives D1 (puts it onto the other end) and the token and then, transmits data D2 and releases the token. Station 3: Receives D1 –> transmits D1 Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives token –> transmits D3 Releases token. Station 4: Receives D1 –> transmits D1 Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives D3 –> transmits D3 Receives token –> transmits D4 Releases token."
Station 1: Receives D1 –> discards D1 as D1 has completed its journey Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives D3 –> transmits D3 Receives D4 –> transmits D4 Receives token –> transmits D1(new) Releases token. (and the cycle continues so on…..)
useful time = N*Tt total time = cycle time = Tp + (THT*N)
"1. Delayed token reinsertion – In this case, THT = Tt + Tp So, cycle time = Tp + N*(Tt + Tp)"
"2. Early token reinsertion – In this case, THT = Tt So, cycle time = Tp + N*(Tt)"
"For a specific purpose if things are connected together, are referred to as a NETWORK. A network can be of many types, like a telephone network, television network, computer network, or even a people network."
"Similarly, a COMPUTER NETWORK is also a kind of setup, where it connects two or more devices to share a range of services and information in the form of e-mails and messages, databases, documents, websites, audios and videos, telephone calls, and video conferences, etc. among them."
"A PROTOCOL is nothing but a set of defined rules, which has to be followed by every connected device across a network to communicate and share information among them. To facilitates End to End communication, a number of protocols worked together to form Protocol Suites or Stacks."
"Network: A collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, that can communicate with each other."
"Node: Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or router."
Protocol: A set of rules and standards that define how devices on a network communicate with each other.
"IP Address: A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to identify and communicate with other devices."
Router: A networking device that connects multiple networks together and forwards data packets between them.
Switch: A networking device that connects devices on a network and forwards data packets between them.
"Firewall: A security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, based on a set of predefined security rules."
"DNS (Domain Name System): A system that translates domain names (such as www.example.com) into IP addresses, allowing devices to locate and connect to websites and other network resources."
"LAN (Local Area Network): A network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building."
"WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that connects devices over a large geographical area, such as multiple offices in different cities or countries."
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): A protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices on a network.
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): A set of protocols used to communicate over the internet and other networks.
"These are just a few basic networking terms, but understanding them is essential to building a strong foundation in computer networking."
"The Network reference models were developed to allow products from different manufacturers to interoperate on a network. A network reference model serves as a blueprint, detailing standards for how protocol communication should occur."
"The most widely recognized reference models are the Open Systems Interconnect ( OSI ) Model and Department of Defense ( DoD, also known as TCP/IP ) model."
An Internetwork is a general term describing multiple networks connected together. The Internet is the largest and most well-known internetwork.
"Normally, Routers are used to divide the broadcast domain and switches (at layer 2) Operate in a single broadcast domain but Switches can also divide the broadcast domain by using the concept of VLAN (Virtual LAN)."
"VLAN is the logical grouping of devices in the same or different broadcast domains. By default, all the switch ports are in VLAN 1. As the single broadcast domain is divided into multiple broadcast domains, Routers or layer 3 switches are used for intercommunication between the different VLANs.The process of intercommunication of the different Vlans is known as Inter Vlan Routing (IVR)."
"Suppose we have made 2 logical groups of devices (VLAN) named sales and finance. If a device in the sales department wants to communicate with a device in the finance department, inter-VLAN routing has to be performed. These can be performed by either router or layer 3 switches."
Switch Virtual Interface (SVI): SVI is a logical interface on a multilayer switch that provides layer 3 processing for packets to all switch ports associated with that VLAN. A single SVI can be created for a VLAN. SVI on the layer 3 switch provides both management and routing services while SVI on layer 2 switch provides only management services like creating VLANs or telnet/SSH services.
Process of Inter Vlan Routing by Layer 3 Switch: The SVI created for the respective VLAN acts as a default gateway for that VLAN just like the sub-interface of the router (in the process of Router On a stick). If the packet is to be delivered to different VLANs i.e inter VLAN Routing is to be performed on the layer 3 switch then first the packet is delivered to the layer 3 switch and then to the destination just like in the process of the router on a stick.
"Here is a topology in which we have a layer 3 switch connected to host devices namely PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4. The hosts PC1, PC2 will be in Vlan 10, and PC3, PC4 will be in Vlan 20. Giving IP addresses to All hosts. PC1-192.168.1.10/24, PC2-192.168.1.20/24, PC3 – 192.168.2.10/24, PC4-192.168.2.20/24."
"Now creating VLANs on layer 3 switches namely VLAN 2 on the switch ports fa0/1, 2 and fa0/3, 4 for VLAN 3."
Now creating SVI for VLAN 2 giving it IP address 192.168.1.1/24 and SVI for VLAN 3 giving IP address 192.168.2.1/24
Now if we will try to ping PC1 to PC4.
"The packet is first delivered to switch then to the destination. As the destination is present in other networks, the packet will be first delivered to the switch which has an SVI for both VLANs (acts as gateway)."
"In the Router on the stick method, both switch and router are needed but while using layer 3 switches, a single switch will perform inter-VLAN routing as well as the layer 2 functions (Vlan), therefore this method is cost-effective and also less configuration is needed."
"1.Network Division:  Inter VLAN directing permits network chairmen to partition the organization into various intelligent portions or VLANs. Each VLAN can have its own IP subnet and security approaches, which further develops network execution and security."
"2.Virtualization: Inter VLAN directing is a fundamental part of organization virtualization, which empowers different virtual organizations to coincide on a similar actual organization foundation. This empowers productive utilization of assets and takes into consideration better organization adaptability."
"3.Load Adjusting: Inter VLAN directing can be utilized to stack balance traffic between VLANs. By circulating traffic across different VLANs, network heads can forestall bottlenecks and further develop network execution."
"4.Access Control: Inter VLAN directing can be utilized to apply access control strategies to traffic between VLANs. For instance, network managers can utilize access control records (leg tendons) to control traffic among VLANs and implement security strategies."
"5.Voice over IP (VoIP): Inter VLAN directing is basic for VoIP executions, which require various VLANs to help various sorts of traffic. VoIP traffic should be isolated from different sorts of traffic to guarantee nature of administration (QoS), and between VLAN steering empowers this division."
"Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) is a popular standard for token passing LANs. In a token bus LAN, the physical media is a bus or a tree, and a logical ring is created using a coaxial cable. The token is passed from one user to another in a sequence (clockwise or anticlockwise). Each station knows the address of the station to its “left” and “right” as per the sequence in the logical ring. A station can only transmit data when it has the token. The working of a token bus is somewhat similar to Token Ring."
"The Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) is a standard for deploying token rings in LANs over a virtual ring. The physical medium uses coaxial cables and has a bus or tree architecture. The nodes/stations form a virtual ring, and the token is transmitted from one node to the next in a sequence along the virtual ring. Each node knows the address of the station before it and the station after it. When a station has the token, it can only broadcast data. The token bus works in a similar way as the Token Ring."
The above diagram shows a logical ring formed in a bus-based token-passing LAN. The logical ring is shown with the arrows.
"Here are, some of the advantages and disadvantages of Token Bus are:"
"Overall, Token Bus has some advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific requirements of the network. It is suitable for use in some situations where reliability and deterministic behavior are important, but may not be the best choice for high-speed, high-bandwidth applications."
The Data Link Layer is responsible for transmission of data between two nodes. Its main functions are-
"Data Link control – The data link control is responsible for reliable transmission of message over transmission channel by using techniques like framing, error control and flow control. For Data link control refer to – Stop and Wait ARQ"
"Multiple Access Control – If there is a dedicated link between the sender and the receiver then data link control layer is sufficient, however if there is no dedicated link present then multiple stations can access the channel simultaneously. Hence multiple access protocols are required to decrease collision and avoid crosstalk. For example, in a classroom full of students, when a teacher asks a question and all the students (or stations) start answering simultaneously (send data at same time) then a lot of chaos is created( data overlap or data lost) then it is the job of the teacher (multiple access protocols) to manage the students and make them answer one at a time."
"Thus, protocols are required for sharing data on non dedicated channels. Multiple access protocols can be subdivided further as –"
"1. Random Access Protocol: In this, all stations have same superiority that is no station has more priority than another station. Any station can send data depending on medium’s state( idle or busy). It has two features:"
"(a) ALOHA – It was designed for wireless LAN but is also applicable for shared medium. In this, multiple stations can transmit data at the same time and can hence lead to collision and data being garbled."
"(b) CSMA – Carrier Sense Multiple Access ensures fewer collisions as the station is required to first sense the medium (for idle or busy) before transmitting data. If it is idle then it sends data, otherwise it waits till the channel becomes idle. However there is still chance of collision in CSMA due to propagation delay. For example, if station A wants to send data, it will first sense the medium.If it finds the channel idle, it will start sending data. However, by the time the first bit of data is transmitted (delayed due to propagation delay) from station A, if station B requests to send data and senses the medium it will also find it idle and will also send data. This will result in collision of data from station A and B."
(c) CSMA/CD – Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection. Stations can terminate transmission of data if collision is detected. For more details refer – Efficiency of CSMA/CD
"(d) CSMA/CA – Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance. The process of collisions detection involves sender receiving acknowledgement signals. If there is just one signal(its own) then the data is successfully sent but if there are two signals(its own and the one with which it has collided) then it means a collision has occurred. To distinguish between these two cases, collision must have a lot of impact on received signal. However it is not so in wired networks, so CSMA/CA is used in this case."
"2. Controlled Access: In this, the data is sent by that station which is approved by all other stations. For further details refer – Controlled Access Protocols"
"3. Channelization: In this, the available bandwidth of the link is shared in time, frequency and code to multiple stations to access channel simultaneously."
"Contention-based access: Multiple access protocols are typically contention-based, meaning that multiple devices compete for access to the communication channel. This can lead to collisions if two or more devices transmit at the same time, which can result in data loss and decreased network performance."
"Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA): CSMA is a widely used multiple access protocol in which devices listen for carrier signals on the communication channel before transmitting. If a carrier signal is detected, the device waits for a random amount of time before attempting to transmit to reduce the likelihood of collisions."
"Collision Detection (CD): CD is a feature of some multiple access protocols that allows devices to detect when a collision has occurred and take appropriate action, such as backing off and retrying the transmission."
Collision Avoidance (CA): CA is a feature of some multiple access protocols that attempts to avoid collisions by assigning time slots to devices for transmission.
"Token passing: Token passing is a multiple access protocol in which devices pass a special token between each other to gain access to the communication channel. Devices can only transmit data when they hold the token, which ensures that only one device can transmit at a time."
"Bandwidth utilization: Multiple access protocols can affect the overall bandwidth utilization of a network. For example, contention-based protocols may result in lower bandwidth utilization due to collisions, while token passing protocols may result in higher bandwidth utilization due to the controlled access to the communication channel."
Please refer this as a prerequisite article: Sliding Window Protocol (sender side)| set 1 Sliding Window Protocol is actually a theoretical concept in which we have only talked about what should be the sender window size (1+2a) in order to increase the efficiency of stop and wait arq. Now we will talk about the practical implementations in which we take care of what should be the size of receiver window. Practically it is implemented in two protocols namely :
"In this article, we will explain you about the first protocol which is GBN in terms of three main characteristic features and in the next part we will be discussing SR as well as comparison of both these protocols"
"What will be the efficiency if processing delay, queuing delay and transmission delay of acknowledgement is not zero."
Relationship Between Window Sizes and Sequence Numbers We already know that sequence numbers required should always be equal to the size of window in any sliding window protocol.
"This is explained with the help of the illustrations below. Trying with Sequence numbers 4.  Now Trying with one extra Sequence Number.  Now it is clear as to why we need an extra 1 bit in the GBN protocol. In the next article, we will explain Selective repeat and comparison between the 2 proto"
EtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology in which multiple physical port links are grouped into one logical link. It is used to provide high-speed links and redundancy. A maximum of 8 links can be aggregated to form a single logical link.
"EtherChannel, also known as Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), is a technique used in computer networks to combine multiple physical links between two network switches into a single logical link. This logical link provides increased bandwidth and redundancy, as well as improved load balancing."
"EtherChannel works by grouping two or more physical links between switches into a single logical link. This logical link is treated as a single entity, with the switches treating it as a single link. Traffic is distributed across the physical links in the logical link, providing increased bandwidth and improved load balancing."
Here is a topology in which two switches are connected with one PC each. The link between the switches and PC is 1000mb/s and the link between the switches is 100mb/s.
"Now, suppose if you want to send traffic of more than 100mb/s then we have congestion as the link between the switches is of 100mb/s only and packets will start dropping. Now, to solve this problem, we should have a high-speed link between the switches. To achieve this, We can simply replace the current link with a high-speed link or we can bundle up more than one link of the same speed of 100mb/s. By forming an EtherChannel, you can bundle up more than one link into a single logical link."
"But, as you connect the switches with more than one link, STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) will block the least redundant link. As we have made an EtherChannel, all the links (that are grouped as one logical link k) will be treated as single logical links therefore no link will be blocked and also, it will provide us high-speed link and redundancy in our network."
"Criteria – To form an EtherChannel, all ports should have:"
"EtherChannel protocols – To form an EtherChannel, there are 2 protocols, port aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and link aggregation control protocol (LACP)."
"1. Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) – The Cisco proprietary protocol Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is an EtherChannel technology. It’s a type of data/traffic load balancing that involves the logical aggregation of Cisco Ethernet switch ports. A PAgP EtherChannel can merge up to eight physical links into one virtual link. LACP, or Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE open standard. These are namely:"
There is a small topology in which 2 switches S1 and S2 are connected with each other and we have to bundle these two links into a single logical link.
"Here, the user has used the mode desirable and switch-port mode trunk. The modes should be the same on both switches therefore the user will configure this on the other switch also."
"2. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) – Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE protocol, originally defined in 802.3ad, used to form an EtherChannel. This protocol is almost similar to Cisco PAgP. There are different modes in which you can configure your interface. These are namely:"
"Taking the same topology, you will now configure LACP on both switches. First, configuring for S1:"
"Increased bandwidth: By combining multiple physical links into a single logical link, EtherChannel provides increased bandwidth between switches. This can help improve network performance and reduce bottlenecks."
"Improved redundancy: EtherChannel provides improved redundancy by allowing traffic to be routed over multiple physical links. If one link fails, traffic is automatically routed over the remaining links."
"Load balancing: EtherChannel distributes traffic across multiple physical links, providing improved load balancing and preventing congestion on any one link."
Simplified network configuration: EtherChannel simplifies network configuration by treating multiple physical links as a single logical link. This can reduce the complexity of network configurations and make troubleshooting easier.
"Cost-effective: EtherChannel can be a cost-effective way to increase bandwidth and redundancy in a network, as it allows existing physical links to be used rather than requiring new hardware."
"Computer Network means an interconnection of autonomous (standalone) computers for information exchange. The connecting media could be a copper wire, optical fiber, microwave, or satellite."
Networking Elements – The computer network includes the following networking elements:
Network Criteria: The criteria that have to be met by a computer network are:
1. Performance – It is measured in terms of transit time and response time.
3. Security – It means protecting data from unauthorized access.
"4. Network topology- it is another crucial factor to consider when designing a computer network. It refers to the way in which computers, devices, and links are arranged in a network. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, scalability, reliability, and performance. The choice of topology depends on the specific needs and constraints of the network. Other important criteria that must be met by a computer network include performance, reliability, and security."
Goals of Computer Networks: The following are some important goals of computer networks:
"Resource sharing: Networks enable the sharing of resources such as printers, scanners, storage devices, and software applications, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency."
"Communication and collaboration: Networks provide a platform for communication and collaboration among users, allowing for easy sharing of information and ideas."
"Centralized management: Networks allow for centralized management of devices, users, and resources, making it easier to control and monitor the network."
"Scalability: Networks can be scaled up or down to accommodate changes in the number of users, devices, or data volume."
"Accessibility: Networks can provide remote access to resources, enabling users to work from anywhere and improving accessibility to information and resources."
"Security vulnerabilities: Networks can be vulnerable to security threats such as hacking, viruses, and malware, which can compromise sensitive data and disrupt network operations."
"Complexity: Networks can be complex to set up, configure, and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and expertise."
"Dependence on infrastructure: Networks depend on the underlying infrastructure such as cables, routers, switches, and servers, which can be prone to failures or downtime, disrupting network operations."
"Cost: Networks can be expensive to set up and maintain, requiring investments in hardware, software, and personnel."
"Performance limitations: Networks have performance limitations such as bandwidth constraints, latency, and congestion, which can affect the speed and reliability of network operations."
"Frames are the units of digital transmission, particularly in computer networks and telecommunications. Frames are comparable to the packets of energy called photons in the case of light energy. Frame is continuously used in Time Division Multiplexing process."
"Framing is a point-to-point connection between two computers or devices consisting of a wire in which data is transmitted as a stream of bits. However, these bits must be framed into discernible blocks of information. Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, and other data link layer technologies have their own frame structures. Frames have headers that contain information such as error-checking codes."
"At the data link layer, it extracts the message from the sender and provides it to the receiver by providing the sender’s and receiver’s addresses. The advantage of using frames is that data is broken up into recoverable chunks that can easily be checked for corruption."
The process of dividing the data into frames and reassembling it is transparent to the user and is handled by the data link layer.
"Framing is an important aspect of data link layer protocol design because it allows the transmission of data to be organized and controlled, ensuring that the data is delivered accurately and efficiently."
"1. Fixed-size: The frame is of fixed size and there is no need to provide boundaries to the frame, the length of the frame itself acts as a delimiter."
"2. Variable size: In this, there is a need to define the end of the frame as well as the beginning of the next frame to distinguish. This can be done in two ways:"
"2. Bit Stuffing: Let ED = 01111 and if data = 01111 –> Sender stuffs a bit to break the pattern i.e. here appends a 0 in data = 011101. –> Receiver receives the frame. –> If data contains 011101, receiver removes the 0 and reads the data."
"Variable frame length: The length of frames can vary depending on the data being transmitted, which can lead to inefficiencies in transmission. To address this issue, protocols such as HDLC and PPP use a flag sequence to mark the start and end of each frame."
"Bit stuffing: Bit stuffing is a technique used to prevent data from being interpreted as control characters by inserting extra bits into the data stream. However, bit stuffing can lead to issues with synchronization and increase the overhead of the transmission."
"Synchronization: Synchronization is critical for ensuring that data frames are transmitted and received correctly. However, synchronization can be challenging, particularly in high-speed networks where frames are transmitted rapidly."
"Error detection: Data Link Layer protocols use various techniques to detect errors in the transmitted data, such as checksums and CRCs. However, these techniques are not foolproof and can miss some types of errors."
"Efficiency: Efficient use of available bandwidth is critical for ensuring that data is transmitted quickly and reliably. However, the overhead associated with framing and error detection can reduce the overall efficiency of the transmission."
"Error is a condition when the receiver’s information does not match the sender’s information. During transmission, digital signals suffer from noise that can introduce errors in the binary bits traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0."
"Data (Implemented either at the Data link layer or Transport Layer of the OSI Model) may get scrambled by noise or get corrupted whenever a message is transmitted. To prevent such errors, error-detection codes are added as extra data to digital messages. This helps in detecting any errors that may have occurred during message transmission."
"A single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting in an incorrect or corrupted data unit."
"A multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors, they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or high-interference digital environments."
"When several consecutive bits are flipped mistakenly in digital transmission, it creates a burst error. This error causes a sequence of consecutive incorrect values."
"To detect errors, a common technique is to introduce redundancy bits that provide additional information. Various techniques for error detection include::"
Simple-bit parity is a simple error detection method that involves adding an extra bit to a data transmission. It works as:
"This scheme makes the total number of 1’s even, that is why it is called even parity checking."
"Two-dimensional Parity check bits are calculated for each row, which is equivalent to a simple parity check bit. Parity check bits are also calculated for all columns, then both are sent along with the data. At the receiving end, these are compared with the parity bits calculated on the received data."
"Checksum error detection is a method used to identify errors in transmitted data. The process involves dividing the data into equally sized segments and using a 1’s complement to calculate the sum of these segments. The calculated sum is then sent along with the data to the receiver. At the receiver’s end, the same process is repeated and if all zeroes are obtained in the sum, it means that the data is correct."
Example: Previous year GATE questions based on error detection: GATE CS 2009 Question 48 GATE CS 2007 Question 68. This article has been contributed by Vikash Kumar.
"Increased Data Reliability: Error detection ensures that the data transmitted over the network is reliable, accurate, and free from errors. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender."
Improved Network Performance: Error detection mechanisms can help to identify and isolate network issues that are causing errors. This can help to improve the overall performance of the network and reduce downtime.
Enhanced Data Security: Error detection can also help to ensure that the data transmitted over the network is secure and has not been tampered with.
"Overhead: Error detection requires additional resources and processing power, which can lead to increased overhead on the network. This can result in slower network performance and increased latency."
"False Positives: Error detection mechanisms can sometimes generate false positives, which can result in unnecessary retransmission of data. This can further increase the overhead on the network."
"Limited Error Correction: Error detection can only identify errors but cannot correct them. This means that the recipient must rely on the sender to retransmit the data, which can lead to further delays and increased network overhead."
This method was developed to decrease the chances of collisions when two or more stations start sending their signals over the data link layer. Carrier Sense multiple access requires that each station first check the state of the medium before sending.
The persistence methods can be applied to help the station take action when the channel is busy/idle.
"In this method, a station monitors the medium after it sends a frame to see if the transmission was successful. If successful, the transmission is finished, if not, the frame is sent again."
"In the diagram, starts sending the first bit of its frame at t1 and since C sees the channel idle at t2, starts sending its frame at t2. C detects A’s frame at t3 and aborts transmission. A detects C’s frame at t4 and aborts its transmission. Transmission time for C’s frame is, therefore, t3-t2         and for A’s frame is t4-t1"
"So, the frame transmission time (Tfr) should be at least twice the maximum propagation time (Tp). This can be deduced when the two stations involved in a collision are a maximum distance apart."
Process: The entire process of collision detection can be explained as follows:
Throughput and Efficiency: The throughput of CSMA/CD is much greater than pure or slotted ALOHA.
"The basic idea behind CSMA/CA is that the station should be able to receive while transmitting to detect a collision from different stations. In wired networks, if a collision has occurred then the energy of the received signal almost doubles, and the station can sense the possibility of collision. In the case of wireless networks, most of the energy is used for transmission, and the energy of the received signal increases by only 5-10% if a collision occurs. It can’t be used by the station to sense collision. Therefore CSMA/CA has been specially designed for wireless networks."
"Overall, CSMA/CA balances the need for efficient use of the shared channel with the need to avoid collisions, leading to reliable and fair communication in a wireless network."
Process: The entire process of collision avoidance can be explained as follows:
There are 4 types of access modes available in CSMA. It is also referred as 4 different types of CSMA protocols which decide the time to start sending data across shared media.
"Attackers’ task is comparatively very easy when they can enter the network they want to attack. Ethernet LANs are very much vulnerable to attack as the switch ports are open to use by default. Various attacks such as Dos attack at layer 2, address spoofing can take place. If the administrator has control over the network then obviously the network is safe. To take total control over the switch ports, the user can use a feature called port-security. If somehow prevent an unauthorized user to use these ports, then the security will increase up to a great extent at layer 2."
"Port security – Switches learn MAC addresses when the frame is forwarded through a switch port. By using port security, users can limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned to a port, set static MAC addresses, and set penalties for that port if it is used by an unauthorized user. Users can either use restrict, shut down or protect port-security commands."
"Note – The port security will work on access port only i.e to enable port security, the user first has to make it an access port."
"Configuration – Applying port-security on fa0/1 interface of switch .first, convert the port to an access port and will enable port-security."
Use sticky command so that it will learn the Mac address dynamically and will provide the limit and the appropriate action that should be taken.
"If the user wants to provide a static entry, then configure that by starting its Mac address."
"Computer Networking is the practice of connecting computers together to enable communication and data exchange between them. In general, Computer Network is a collection of two or more computers. It helps users to communicate more easily. In this article, we are going to discuss the basics which everyone must know before going deep into Computer Networking."
"Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links. A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more. Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks."
"The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate. Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device."
"These are just a few basic concepts of computer networking. Networking is a vast and complex field, and there are many more concepts and technologies involved in building and maintaining networks. Now we are going to discuss some more concepts on Computer Networking."
"An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges."
"The Network Topology is the layout arrangement of the different devices in a network. Common examples include Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, and Daisy chain."
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer. The OSI has been developed by the International Organization For Standardization and it is 7 layer architecture. Each layer of OSI has different functions and each layer has to follow different protocols. The 7 layers are as follows:
"A protocol is a set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network and there exists a different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model. A few such protocols are TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP, and so on."
"Hostname: Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as Hostname. Type “hostname” in the command prompt(Administrator Mode) and press ‘Enter’, this displays the hostname of your machine."
"IP Address (Internet Protocol address):  Also known as the Logical Address, the IP Address is the network address of the system across the network. To identify each device in the world-wide-web, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns an IPV4 (Version 4) address as a unique identifier to each device on the Internet. The length of an IPv4 address is 32 bits, hence, we have 232 IP addresses available. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits.Type “ipconfig” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this gives us the IP address of the device."
"MAC Address (Media Access Control address): Also known as physical address, the MAC Address is the unique identifier of each host and is associated with its NIC (Network Interface Card). A MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. The length of the MAC address is: 12-nibble/ 6 bytes/ 48 bits Type “ipconfig/all” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this gives us the MAC address."
"Port: A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. Any host may have multiple applications running, and each of these applications is identified using the port number on which they are running."
"A port number is a 16-bit integer, hence, we have 216 ports available which are categorized as shown below:"
"Number of ports: 65,536 Range: 0 – 65535 Type “netstat -a” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this lists all the ports being used."
Socket: The unique combination of IP address and Port number together is termed a Socket.
DNS Server: DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is basically a server that translates web addresses or URLs (ex: www.google.com) into their corresponding IP addresses. We don’t have to remember all the IP addresses of each and every website. The command ‘nslookup’ gives you the IP address of the domain you are looking for. This also provides information on our DNS Server. \
"ARP: ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is used to convert an IP address to its corresponding physical address(i.e., MAC Address). ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine."
"RARP: RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. As the name suggests, it provides the IP address of the device given a physical address as input. But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into the picture."
"Our Computer Network tutorial includes all topics of Computer Network such as introduction, features, types of computer network, architecture, hardware, software, internet, intranet, website, LAN, WAN, etc."
"A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving the data. The links connecting the nodes are known as communication channels."
"Computer Network uses distributed processing in which task is divided among several computers. Instead, a single computer handles an entire task, each separate computer handles a subset."
"Security: It provides limited interaction that a user can have with the entire system. For example, a bank allows the users to access their own accounts through an ATM without allowing them to access the bank's entire database."
Faster problem solving: Multiple computers can solve the problem faster than a single machine working alone.
"Security through redundancy: Multiple computers running the same program at the same time can provide the security through redundancy. For example, if four computers run the same program and any computer has a hardware error, then other computers can override it."
Our Computer Network Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.
"We assure that you will not find any problem in this Computer Network Tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in contact form."
"Computer Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires, optical fibres or optical links so that various devices can interact with each other through a network."
The aim of the computer network is the sharing of resources among various devices.
"In the case of computer network technology, there are several types of networks that vary from simple to complex level."
"NIC is a device that helps the computer to communicate with another device. The network interface card contains the hardware addresses, the data-link layer protocol use this address to identify the system on the network so that it transfers the data to the correct destination."
There are two types of NIC: wireless NIC and wired NIC.
"Wireless NIC: All the modern laptops use the wireless NIC. In Wireless NIC, a connection is made using the antenna that employs the radio wave technology."
Wired NIC: Cables use the wired NIC to transfer the data over the medium.
"Hub is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices. When computer requests for information from a computer, it sends the request to the Hub. Hub distributes this request to all the interconnected computers."
"Switch is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another device. A switch is better than Hub as it does not broadcast the message over the network, i.e., it sends the message to the device for which it belongs to. Therefore, we can say that switch sends the message directly from source to the destination."
Cable is a transmission media that transmits the communication signals. There are three types of cables:
Twisted pair cable: It is a high-speed cable that transmits the data over 1Gbps or more.
"Coaxial cable: Coaxial cable resembles like a TV installation cable. Coaxial cable is more expensive than twisted pair cable, but it provides the high data transmission speed."
"Fibre optic cable: Fibre optic cable is a high-speed cable that transmits the data using light beams. It provides high data transmission speed as compared to other cables. It is more expensive as compared to other cables, so it is installed at the government level."
Router is a device that connects the LAN to the internet. The router is mainly used to connect the distinct networks or connect the internet to multiple computers.
Modem connects the computer to the internet over the existing telephone line. A modem is not integrated with the computer motherboard. A modem is a separate part on the PC slot found on the motherboard.
"Resource sharing: Resource sharing is the sharing of resources such as programs, printers, and data among the users on the network without the requirement of the physical location of the resource and user."
Server-Client model: Computer networking is used in the server-client model. A server is a central computer used to store the information and maintained by the system administrator. Clients are the machines used to access the information stored in the server remotely.
"Communication medium: Computer network behaves as a communication medium among the users. For example, a company contains more than one computer has an email system which the employees use for daily communication."
"E-commerce: Computer network is also important in businesses. We can do the business over the internet. For example, amazon.com is doing their business over the internet, i.e., they are doing their business over the internet."
"Network provides us to communicate over the network in a fast and efficient manner. For example, we can do video conferencing, email messaging, etc. over the internet. Therefore, the computer network is a great way to share our knowledge and ideas."
File sharing is one of the major advantage of the computer network. Computer network provides us to share the files with each other.
"Since the files are stored in the main server which is centrally located. Therefore, it is easy to take the back up from the main server."
"We can install the applications on the main server, therefore, the user can access the applications centrally. So, we do not need to install the software on every machine. Similarly, hardware can also be shared."
Network allows the security by ensuring that the user has the right to access the certain files and applications.
"Scalability means that we can add the new components on the network. Network must be scalable so that we can extend the network by adding new devices. But, it decreases the speed of the connection and data of the transmission speed also decreases, this increases the chances of error occurring. This problem can be overcome by using the routing or switching devices."
Computer network can use the alternative source for the data communication in case of any hardware failure.
"Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer."
Peer-To-Peer network is a network in which all the computers are linked together with equal privilege and responsibilities for processing the data.
"Peer-To-Peer network is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers."
"Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a problem if the computer with the resource is down."
It is less costly as it does not contain any dedicated server.
"If one computer stops working but, other computers will not stop working."
It is easy to set up and maintain as each computer manages itself.
"In the case of Peer-To-Peer network, it does not contain the centralized system . Therefore, it cannot back up the data as the data is different in different locations."
It has a security issue as the device is managed itself.
"Client/Server network is a network model designed for the end users called clients, to access the resources such as songs, video, etc. from a central computer known as Server."
The central controller is known as a server while all other computers in the network are called clients.
A server performs all the major operations such as security and network management.
"A server is responsible for managing all the resources such as files, directories, printer, etc."
"All the clients communicate with each other through a server. For example, if client1 wants to send some data to client 2, then it first sends the request to the server for the permission. The server sends the response to the client 1 to initiate its communication with the client 2."
A Client/Server network contains the centralized system. Therefore we can back up the data easily.
A Client/Server network has a dedicated server that improves the overall performance of the whole system.
Security is better in Client/Server network as a single server administers the shared resources.
Client/Server network is expensive as it requires the server with large memory.
"A server has a Network Operating System(NOS) to provide the resources to the clients, but the cost of NOS is very high."
It requires a dedicated network administrator to manage all the resources.
"Computer network components are the major parts which are needed to install the software. Some important network components are NIC, switch, cable, hub, router, and modem. Depending on the type of network that we need to install, some network components can also be removed. For example, the wireless network does not require a cable."
Following are the major components required to install a network:
NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network
"It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s."
The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely. The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).
Wired NIC: The Wired NIC is present inside the motherboard. Cables and connectors are used with wired NIC to transfer data.
"Wireless NIC: The wireless NIC contains the antenna to obtain the connection over the wireless network. For example, laptop computer contains the wireless NIC."
"A Hub is a hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices. When computer requests for some information from a network, it first sends the request to the Hub through cable. Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not. If not, the request will be dropped."
"The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication. Nowadays, the use of hub is obsolete, and it is replaced by more advanced computer network components such as Switches, Routers."
"A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a computer network. A Switch contains more advanced features than Hub. The Switch contains the updated table that decides where the data is transmitted or not. Switch delivers the message to the correct destination based on the physical address present in the incoming message. A Switch does not broadcast the message to the entire network like the Hub. It determines the device to whom the message is to be transmitted. Therefore, we can say that switch provides a direct connection between the source and destination. It increases the speed of the network."
"A router is a hardware device which is used to connect a LAN with an internet connection. It is used to receive, analyze and forward the incoming packets to another network."
A router works in a Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI Reference model.
A router forwards the packet based on the information available in the routing table.
It determines the best path from the available paths for the transmission of the packet.
"Security: The information which is transmitted to the network will traverse the entire cable, but the only specified device which has been addressed can read the data."
"Reliability: If the server has stopped functioning, the network goes down, but no other networks are affected that are served by the router."
"Performance: Router enhances the overall performance of the network. Suppose there are 24 workstations in a network generates a same amount of traffic. This increases the traffic load on the network. Router splits the single network into two networks of 12 workstations each, reduces the traffic load by half."
A modem is a hardware device that allows the computer to connect to the internet over the existing telephone line.
A modem is not integrated with the motherboard rather than it is installed on the PCI slot found on the motherboard.
It stands for Modulator/Demodulator. It converts the digital data into an analog signal over the telephone lines.
"Based on the differences in speed and transmission rate, a modem can be classified in the following categories:"
Cable is a transmission media used for transmitting a signal.
"A computer network is a group of computers linked to each other that enables the computer to communicate with another computer and share their resources, data, and applications."
A computer network can be categorized by their size. A computer network is mainly of four types:
"Local Area Network is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as building, office."
"LAN is used for connecting two or more personal computers through a communication medium such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, etc."
"It is less costly as it is built with inexpensive hardware such as hubs, network adapters, and ethernet cables."
The data is transferred at an extremely faster rate in Local Area Network.
"Personal Area Network is a network arranged within an individual person, typically within a range of 10 meters."
Personal Area Network is used for connecting the computer devices of personal use is known as Personal Area Network.
Thomas Zimmerman was the first research scientist to bring the idea of the Personal Area Network.
"Personal computer devices that are used to develop the personal area network are the laptop, mobile phones, media player and play stations."
"Wireless Personal Area Network: Wireless Personal Area Network is developed by simply using wireless technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth. It is a low range network."
Wired Personal Area Network: Wired Personal Area Network is created by using the USB.
"Body Area Network: Body Area Network is a network that moves with a person. For example, a mobile network moves with a person. Suppose a person establishes a network connection and then creates a connection with another device to share the information."
"Offline Network: An offline network can be created inside the home, so it is also known as a home network. A home network is designed to integrate the devices such as printers, computer, television but they are not connected to the internet."
Small Home Office: It is used to connect a variety of devices to the internet and to a corporate network using a VPN
A metropolitan area network is a network that covers a larger geographic area by interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network.
Government agencies use MAN to connect to the citizens and private industries.
"In MAN, various LANs are connected to each other through a telephone exchange line."
"The most widely used protocols in MAN are RS-232, Frame Relay, ATM, ISDN, OC-3, ADSL, etc."
MAN is used in communication between the banks in a city.
It can be used in a college within a city.
It can also be used for communication in the military.
A Wide Area Network is a network that extends over a large geographical area such as states or countries.
A Wide Area Network is quite bigger network than the LAN.
"A Wide Area Network is not limited to a single location, but it spans over a large geographical area through a telephone line, fibre optic cable or satellite links."
The internet is one of the biggest WAN in the world.
"A Wide Area Network is widely used in the field of Business, government, and education."
Mobile Broadband: A 4G network is widely used across a region or country.
Last mile: A telecom company is used to provide the internet services to the customers in hundreds of cities by connecting their home with fiber.
Private network: A bank provides a private network that connects the 44 offices. This network is made by using the telephone leased line provided by the telecom company.
Geographical area: A Wide Area Network provides a large geographical area. Suppose if the branch of our office is in a different city then we can connect with them through WAN. The internet provides a leased line through which we can connect with another branch.
"Centralized data: In case of WAN network, data is centralized. Therefore, we do not need to buy the emails, files or back up servers."
"Get updated files: Software companies work on the live server. Therefore, the programmers get the updated files within seconds."
"Exchange messages: In a WAN network, messages are transmitted fast. The web application like Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype allows you to communicate with friends."
"Sharing of software and resources: In WAN network, we can share the software and other resources like a hard drive, RAM."
Global business: We can do the business over the internet globally.
High bandwidth: If we use the leased lines for our company then this gives the high bandwidth. The high bandwidth increases the data transfer rate which in turn increases the productivity of our company.
The following are the disadvantages of the Wide Area Network:
Security issue: A WAN network has more security issues as compared to LAN and MAN network as all the technologies are combined together that creates the security problem.
"Needs Firewall & antivirus software: The data is transferred on the internet which can be changed or hacked by the hackers, so the firewall needs to be used. Some people can inject the virus in our system so antivirus is needed to protect from such a virus."
"High Setup cost: An installation cost of the WAN network is high as it involves the purchasing of routers, switches."
Troubleshooting problems: It covers a large area so fixing the problem is difficult.
"An internetwork is defined as two or more computer network LANs or WAN or computer network segments are connected using devices, and they are configured by a local addressing scheme. This process is known as internetworking."
"An interconnection between public, private, commercial, industrial, or government computer networks can also be defined as internetworking."
The reference model used for internetworking is Open System Interconnection(OSI).
"1. Extranet: An extranet is a communication network based on the internet protocol such as Transmission Control protocol and internet protocol. It is used for information sharing. The access to the extranet is restricted to only those users who have login credentials. An extranet is the lowest level of internetworking. It can be categorized as MAN, WAN or other computer networks. An extranet cannot have a single LAN, atleast it must have one connection to the external network."
2. Intranet: An intranet is a private network based on the internet protocol such as Transmission Control protocol and internet protocol. An intranet belongs to an organization which is only accessible by the organization's employee or members. The main aim of the intranet is to share the information and resources among the organization employees. An intranet provides the facility to work in groups and for teleconferences.
"Communication: It provides a cheap and easy communication. An employee of the organization can communicate with another employee through email, chat."
"Time-saving: Information on the intranet is shared in real time, so it is time-saving."
Collaboration: Collaboration is one of the most important advantage of the intranet. The information is distributed among the employees of the organization and can only be accessed by the authorized user.
Platform independency: It is a neutral architecture as the computer can be connected to another device with different architecture.
Cost effective: People can see the data and documents by using the browser and distributes the duplicate copies over the intranet. This leads to a reduction in the cost.
Topology defines the structure of the network of how all the components are interconnected to each other. There are two types of topology: physical and logical topology.
"Physical topology is the geometric representation of all the nodes in a network. There are six types of network topology which are Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Tree Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, and Hybrid Topology."
The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable.
Each node is either connected to the backbone cable by drop cable or directly connected to the backbone cable.
"When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network. All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not."
The bus topology is mainly used in 802.3 (ethernet) and 802.4 standard networks.
The configuration of a bus topology is quite simpler as compared to other topologies.
"The backbone cable is considered as a ""single lane"" through which the message is broadcast to all the stations."
The most common access method of the bus topologies is CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access).
"CSMA: It is a media access control used to control the data flow so that data integrity is maintained, i.e., the packets do not get lost. There are two alternative ways of handling the problems that occur when two nodes send the messages simultaneously."
"CSMA CD: CSMA CD (Collision detection) is an access method used to detect the collision. Once the collision is detected, the sender will stop transmitting the data. Therefore, it works on ""recovery after the collision""."
"CSMA CA: CSMA CA (Collision Avoidance) is an access method used to avoid the collision by checking whether the transmission media is busy or not. If busy, then the sender waits until the media becomes idle. This technique effectively reduces the possibility of the collision. It does not work on ""recovery after the collision""."
"Low-cost cable: In bus topology, nodes are directly connected to the cable without passing through a hub. Therefore, the initial cost of installation is low."
Moderate data speeds: Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support upto 10 Mbps.
"Familiar technology: Bus topology is a familiar technology as the installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known, and hardware components are easily available."
Limited failure: A failure in one node will not have any effect on other nodes.
"Extensive cabling: A bus topology is quite simpler, but still it requires a lot of cabling."
"Difficult troubleshooting: It requires specialized test equipment to determine the cable faults. If any fault occurs in the cable, then it would disrupt the communication for all the nodes."
"Signal interference: If two nodes send the messages simultaneously, then the signals of both the nodes collide with each other."
Reconfiguration difficult: Adding new devices to the network would slow down the network.
Attenuation: Attenuation is a loss of signal leads to communication issues. Repeaters are used to regenerate the signal.
"Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends."
The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.
"The data flows in one direction, i.e., it is unidirectional."
The data flows in a single loop continuously known as an endless loop.
"It has no terminated ends, i.e., each node is connected to other node and having no termination point."
The data in a ring topology flow in a clockwise direction.
"The most common access method of the ring topology is token passing.

Token passing: It is a network access method in which token is passed from one node to another node.
Token: It is a frame that circulates around the network."
Token passing: It is a network access method in which token is passed from one node to another node.
Token: It is a frame that circulates around the network.
"A token moves around the network, and it is passed from computer to computer until it reaches the destination."
The sender modifies the token by putting the address along with the data.
"The data is passed from one device to another device until the destination address matches. Once the token received by the destination device, then it sends the acknowledgment to the sender."
"In a ring topology, a token is used as a carrier."
Network Management: Faulty devices can be removed from the network without bringing the network down.
Product availability: Many hardware and software tools for network operation and monitoring are available.
"Cost: Twisted pair cabling is inexpensive and easily available. Therefore, the installation cost is very low."
Reliable: It is a more reliable network because the communication system is not dependent on the single host computer.
"Difficult troubleshooting: It requires specialized test equipment to determine the cable faults. If any fault occurs in the cable, then it would disrupt the communication for all the nodes."
Failure: The breakdown in one station leads to the failure of the overall network.
Reconfiguration difficult: Adding new devices to the network would slow down the network.
Delay: Communication delay is directly proportional to the number of nodes. Adding new devices increases the communication delay.
"Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer."
"The central computer is known as a server, and the peripheral devices attached to the server are known as clients."
Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers.
Hubs or Switches are mainly used as connection devices in a physical star topology.
Star topology is the most popular topology in network implementation.
"Efficient troubleshooting: Troubleshooting is quite efficient in a star topology as compared to bus topology. In a bus topology, the manager has to inspect the kilometers of cable. In a star topology, all the stations are connected to the centralized network. Therefore, the network administrator has to go to the single station to troubleshoot the problem."
Network control: Complex network control features can be easily implemented in the star topology. Any changes made in the star topology are automatically accommodated.
"Limited failure: As each station is connected to the central hub with its own cable, therefore failure in one cable will not affect the entire network."
Familiar technology: Star topology is a familiar technology as its tools are cost-effective.
Easily expandable: It is easily expandable as new stations can be added to the open ports on the hub.
Cost effective: Star topology networks are cost-effective as it uses inexpensive coaxial cable.
High data speeds: It supports a bandwidth of approx 100Mbps. Ethernet 100BaseT is one of the most popular Star topology networks.
"A Central point of failure: If the central hub or switch goes down, then all the connected nodes will not be able to communicate with each other."
Cable: Sometimes cable routing becomes difficult when a significant amount of routing is required.
Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
A tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in hierarchical fashion.
"The top-most node in tree topology is known as a root node, and all other nodes are the descendants of the root node."
"There is only one path exists between two nodes for the data transmission. Thus, it forms a parent-child hierarchy."
"Support for broadband transmission: Tree topology is mainly used to provide broadband transmission, i.e., signals are sent over long distances without being attenuated."
"Easily expandable: We can add the new device to the existing network. Therefore, we can say that tree topology is easily expandable."
"Easily manageable: In tree topology, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which can be easily managed and maintained."
Error detection: Error detection and error correction are very easy in a tree topology.
Limited failure: The breakdown in one station does not affect the entire network.
"Difficult troubleshooting: If any fault occurs in the node, then it becomes difficult to troubleshoot the problem."
High cost: Devices required for broadband transmission are very costly.
Failure: A tree topology mainly relies on main bus cable and failure in main bus cable will damage the overall network.
"Reconfiguration difficult: If new devices are added, then it becomes difficult to reconfigure."
Mesh technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections.
There are multiple paths from one computer to another computer.
"It does not contain the switch, hub or any central computer which acts as a central point of communication."
Mesh topology is mainly used for WAN implementations where communication failures are a critical concern.
"Mesh topology can be formed by using the formula:
Number of cables = (n*(n-1))/2;"
Where n is the number of nodes that represents the network.
"Full Mesh Topology: In a full mesh topology, each computer is connected to all the computers available in the network."
"Partial Mesh Topology: In a partial mesh topology, not all but certain computers are connected to those computers with which they communicate frequently."
Reliable: The mesh topology networks are very reliable as if any link breakdown will not affect the communication between connected computers.
Easier Reconfiguration: Adding new devices would not disrupt the communication between other devices.
Cost: A mesh topology contains a large number of connected devices such as a router and more transmission media than other topologies.
"Management: Mesh topology networks are very large and very difficult to maintain and manage. If the network is not monitored carefully, then the communication link failure goes undetected."
"Efficiency: In this topology, redundant connections are high that reduces the efficiency of the network."
The combination of various different topologies is known as Hybrid topology.
A Hybrid topology is a connection between different links and nodes to transfer the data.
"When two or more different topologies are combined together is termed as Hybrid topology and if similar topologies are connected with each other will not result in Hybrid topology. For example, if there exist a ring topology in one branch of ICICI bank and bus topology in another branch of ICICI bank, connecting these two topologies will result in Hybrid topology."
Reliable: If a fault occurs in any part of the network will not affect the functioning of the rest of the network.
Scalable: Size of the network can be easily expanded by adding new devices without affecting the functionality of the existing network.
Flexible: This topology is very flexible as it can be designed according to the requirements of the organization.
Effective: Hybrid topology is very effective as it can be designed in such a way that the strength of the network is maximized and weakness of the network is minimized.
Complex design: The major drawback of the Hybrid topology is the design of the Hybrid network. It is very difficult to design the architecture of the Hybrid network.
Costly Hub: The Hubs used in the Hybrid topology are very expensive as these hubs are different from usual Hubs used in other topologies.
"Costly infrastructure: The infrastructure cost is very high as a hybrid network requires a lot of cabling, network devices, etc."
The way in which data is transmitted from one device to another device is known as transmission mode.
The transmission mode is also known as the communication mode.
"Each communication channel has a direction associated with it, and transmission media provide the direction. Therefore, the transmission mode is also known as a directional mode."
"In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, i.e., the data flow in one direction."
A device can only send the data but cannot receive it or it can receive the data but cannot send the data.
This transmission mode is not very popular as mainly communications require the two-way exchange of data. The simplex mode is used in the business field as in sales that do not require any corresponding reply.
The radio station is a simplex channel as it transmits the signal to the listeners but never allows them to transmit back.
Keyboard and Monitor are the examples of the simplex mode as a keyboard can only accept the data from the user and monitor can only be used to display the data on the screen.
The main advantage of the simplex mode is that the full capacity of the communication channel can be utilized during transmission.
"In simplex mode, the station can utilize the entire bandwidth of the communication channel, so that more data can be transmitted at a time."
"Communication is unidirectional, so it has no inter-communication between devices."
"In a Half-duplex channel, direction can be reversed, i.e., the station can transmit and receive the data as well."
"Messages flow in both the directions, but not at the same time."
The entire bandwidth of the communication channel is utilized in one direction at a time.
"In half-duplex mode, it is possible to perform the error detection, and if any error occurs, then the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the data."
"A Walkie-talkie is an example of the Half-duplex mode. In Walkie-talkie, one party speaks, and another party listens. After a pause, the other speaks and first party listens. Speaking simultaneously will create the distorted sound which cannot be understood."
"In half-duplex mode, both the devices can send and receive the data and also can utilize the entire bandwidth of the communication channel during the transmission of data."
"In half-duplex mode, when one device is sending the data, then another has to wait, this causes the delay in sending the data at the right time."
"In Full duplex mode, the communication is bi-directional, i.e., the data flow in both the directions."
Both the stations can send and receive the message simultaneously.
"Full-duplex mode has two simplex channels. One channel has traffic moving in one direction, and another channel has traffic flowing in the opposite direction."
The Full-duplex mode is the fastest mode of communication between devices.
"The most common example of the full-duplex mode is a telephone network. When two people are communicating with each other by a telephone line, both can talk and listen at the same time."
Both the stations can send and receive the data at the same time.
"If there is no dedicated path exists between the devices, then the capacity of the communication channel is divided into two parts."
"A communication subsystem is a complex piece of Hardware and software. Early attempts for implementing the software for such subsystems were based on a single, complex, unstructured program with many interacting components. The resultant software was very difficult to test and modify. To overcome such problem, the ISO has developed a layered approach. In a layered approach, networking concept is divided into several layers, and each layer is assigned a particular task. Therefore, we can say that networking tasks depend upon the layers."
The main aim of the layered architecture is to divide the design into small pieces.
Each lower layer adds its services to the higher layer to provide a full set of services to manage communications and run the applications.
"It provides modularity and clear interfaces, i.e., provides interaction between subsystems."
"It ensures the independence between layers by providing the services from lower to higher layer without defining how the services are implemented. Therefore, any modification in a layer will not affect the other layers."
"The number of layers, functions, contents of each layer will vary from network to network. However, the purpose of each layer is to provide the service from lower to a higher layer and hiding the details from the layers of how the services are implemented."
"The basic elements of layered architecture are services, protocols, and interfaces.

Service: It is a set of actions that a layer provides to the higher layer.
Protocol: It defines a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange the information with peer entity. These rules mainly concern about both the contents and order of the messages used.
Interface: It is a way through which the message is transferred from one layer to another layer."
Service: It is a set of actions that a layer provides to the higher layer.
Protocol: It defines a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange the information with peer entity. These rules mainly concern about both the contents and order of the messages used.
Interface: It is a way through which the message is transferred from one layer to another layer.
"In a layer n architecture, layer n on one machine will have a communication with the layer n on another machine and the rules used in a conversation are known as a layer-n protocol."
"In case of layered architecture, no data is transferred from layer n of one machine to layer n of another machine. Instead, each layer passes the data to the layer immediately just below it, until the lowest layer is reached."
Below layer 1 is the physical medium through which the actual communication takes place.
"In a layered architecture, unmanageable tasks are divided into several small and manageable tasks."
The data is passed from the upper layer to lower layer through an interface. A Layered architecture provides a clean-cut interface so that minimum information is shared among different layers. It also ensures that the implementation of one layer can be easily replaced by another implementation.
A set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture.
"Divide-and-conquer approach: Divide-and-conquer approach makes a design process in such a way that the unmanageable tasks are divided into small and manageable tasks. In short, we can say that this approach reduces the complexity of the design."
"Modularity: Layered architecture is more modular. Modularity provides the independence of layers, which is easier to understand and implement."
Easy to modify: It ensures the independence of layers so that implementation in one layer can be changed without affecting other layers.
Easy to test: Each layer of the layered architecture can be analyzed and tested individually.
OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
"OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function."
"OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications."
OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.
"Each layer is self-contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently."
The OSI model is divided into two layers: upper layers and lower layers.
"The upper layer of the OSI model mainly deals with the application related issues, and they are implemented only in the software. The application layer is closest to the end user. Both the end user and the application layer interact with the software applications. An upper layer refers to the layer just above another layer."
The lower layer of the OSI model deals with the data transport issues. The data link layer and the physical layer are implemented in hardware and software. The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is closest to the physical medium. The physical layer is mainly responsible for placing the information on the physical medium.
There are the seven OSI layers. Each layer has different functions. A list of seven layers are given below:
The main functionality of the physical layer is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.
"It specifies the mechanical, electrical and procedural network interface specifications."
Line Configuration: It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.
"Data Transmission: It defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex mode between the two devices on the network."
Topology: It defines the way how network devices are arranged.
Signals: It determines the type of the signal used for transmitting the information.
This layer is responsible for the error-free transfer of data frames.
It defines the format of the data on the network.
It provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices.
It is mainly responsible for the unique identification of each device that resides on a local network.
"It contains two sub-layers:

Logical Link Control Layer

It is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving.
It identifies the address of the network layer protocol from the header.
It also provides flow control.


Media Access Control Layer

A Media access control layer is a link between the Logical Link Control layer and the network's physical layer.
It is used for transferring the packets over the network."
"Logical Link Control Layer

It is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving.
It identifies the address of the network layer protocol from the header.
It also provides flow control."

"Media Access Control Layer

A Media access control layer is a link between the Logical Link Control layer and the network's physical layer.
It is used for transferring the packets over the network."
A Media access control layer is a link between the Logical Link Control layer and the network's physical layer.
It is used for transferring the packets over the network.
Framing: The data link layer translates the physical's raw bit stream into packets known as Frames. The Data link layer adds the header and trailer to the frame. The header which is added to the frame contains the hardware destination and source address.
Physical Addressing: The Data link layer adds a header to the frame that contains a destination address. The frame is transmitted to the destination address mentioned in the header.
"Flow Control: Flow control is the main functionality of the Data-link layer. It is the technique through which the constant data rate is maintained on both the sides so that no data get corrupted. It ensures that the transmitting station such as a server with higher processing speed does not exceed the receiving station, with lower processing speed."
"Error Control: Error control is achieved by adding a calculated value CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) that is placed to the Data link layer's trailer which is added to the message frame before it is sent to the physical layer. If any error seems to occurr, then the receiver sends the acknowledgment for the retransmission of the corrupted frames."
"Access Control: When two or more devices are connected to the same communication channel, then the data link layer protocols are used to determine which device has control over the link at a given time."
"It is a layer 3 that manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network."
"It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors."
The Data link layer is responsible for routing and forwarding the packets.
"Routers are the layer 3 devices, they are specified in this layer and used to provide the routing services within an internetwork."
The protocols used to route the network traffic are known as Network layer protocols. Examples of protocols are IP and Ipv6.
Internetworking: An internetworking is the main responsibility of the network layer. It provides a logical connection between different devices.
Addressing: A Network layer adds the source and destination address to the header of the frame. Addressing is used to identify the device on the internet.
"Routing: Routing is the major component of the network layer, and it determines the best optimal path out of the multiple paths from source to the destination."
Packetizing: A Network Layer receives the packets from the upper layer and converts them into packets. This process is known as Packetizing. It is achieved by internet protocol (IP).
The Transport layer is a Layer 4 ensures that messages are transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data.
The main responsibility of the transport layer is to transfer the data completely.
It receives the data from the upper layer and converts them into smaller units known as segments.
This layer can be termed as an end-to-end layer as it provides a point-to-point connection between source and destination to deliver the data reliably.
"Transmission Control Protocol

It is a standard protocol that allows the systems to communicate over the internet. 
It establishes and maintains a connection between hosts.
When data is sent over the TCP connection, then the TCP protocol divides the data into smaller units known as segments. Each segment travels over the internet using multiple routes, and they arrive in different orders at the destination. The transmission control protocol reorders the packets in the correct order at the receiving end."

Each segment travels over the internet using multiple routes, and they arrive in different orders at the destination. The transmission control protocol reorders the packets in the correct order at the receiving end."
"User Datagram Protocol

User Datagram Protocol is a transport layer protocol.
It is an unreliable transport protocol as in this case receiver does not send any acknowledgment when the packet is received, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgment. Therefore, this makes a protocol unreliable."
"It is an unreliable transport protocol as in this case receiver does not send any acknowledgment when the packet is received, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgment. Therefore, this makes a protocol unreliable."
"Service-point addressing: Computers run several programs simultaneously due to this reason, the transmission of data from source to the destination not only from one computer to another computer but also from one process to another process. The transport layer adds the header that contains the address known as a service-point address or port address. The responsibility of the network layer is to transmit the data from one computer to another computer and the responsibility of the transport layer is to transmit the message to the correct process."
"Segmentation and reassembly: When the transport layer receives the message from the upper layer, it divides the message into multiple segments, and each segment is assigned with a sequence number that uniquely identifies each segment. When the message has arrived at the destination, then the transport layer reassembles the message based on their sequence numbers."
"Connection control: Transport layer provides two services Connection-oriented service and connectionless service. A connectionless service treats each segment as an individual packet, and they all travel in different routes to reach the destination. A connection-oriented service makes a connection with the transport layer at the destination machine before delivering the packets. In connection-oriented service, all the packets travel in the single route."
Flow control: The transport layer also responsible for flow control but it is performed end-to-end rather than across a single link.
Error control: The transport layer is also responsible for Error control. Error control is performed end-to-end rather than across the single link. The sender transport layer ensures that message reach at the destination without any error.
"The Session layer is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices."
Dialog control: Session layer acts as a dialog controller that creates a dialog between two processes or we can say that it allows the communication between two processes which can be either half-duplex or full-duplex.
"Synchronization: Session layer adds some checkpoints when transmitting the data in a sequence. If some error occurs in the middle of the transmission of data, then the transmission will take place again from the checkpoint. This process is known as Synchronization and recovery."
A Presentation layer is mainly concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between the two systems.
This layer is a part of the operating system that converts the data from one presentation format to another format.
The Presentation layer is also known as the syntax layer.
"Translation: The processes in two systems exchange the information in the form of character strings, numbers and so on. Different computers use different encoding methods, the presentation layer handles the interoperability between the different encoding methods. It converts the data from sender-dependent format into a common format and changes the common format into receiver-dependent format at the receiving end."
Encryption: Encryption is needed to maintain privacy. Encryption is a process of converting the sender-transmitted information into another form and sends the resulting message over the network.
"Compression: Data compression is a process of compressing the data, i.e., it reduces the number of bits to be transmitted. Data compression is very important in multimedia such as text, audio, video."
An application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network service.
"It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation, etc."
"An application layer is not an application, but it performs the application layer functions."
"File transfer, access, and management (FTAM): An application layer allows a user to access the files in a remote computer, to retrieve the files from a computer and to manage the files in a remote computer."
Mail services: An application layer provides the facility for email forwarding and storage.
Directory services: An application provides the distributed database sources and is used to provide that global information about various objects.
The TCP/IP model was developed prior to the OSI model.
The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model.
"The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer."
"The first four layers provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model and these four layers are represented in TCP/IP model by a single layer called the application layer."
"TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality."
"Here, hierarchical means that each upper-layer protocol is supported by two or more lower-level protocols."
A network layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model.
A network layer is the combination of the Physical layer and Data Link layer defined in the OSI reference model.
It defines how the data should be sent physically through the network.
This layer is mainly responsible for the transmission of the data between two devices on the same network.
The functions carried out by this layer are encapsulating the IP datagram into frames transmitted by the network and mapping of IP addresses into physical addresses.
"The protocols used by this layer are ethernet, token ring, FDDI, X.25, frame relay."
An internet layer is the second layer of the TCP/IP model.
An internet layer is also known as the network layer.
"The main responsibility of the internet layer is to send the packets from any network, and they arrive at the destination irrespective of the route they take."
"IP Protocol: IP protocol is used in this layer, and it is the most significant part of the entire TCP/IP suite."
IP Addressing: This protocol implements logical host addresses known as IP addresses. The IP addresses are used by the internet and higher layers to identify the device and to provide internetwork routing.
Host-to-host communication: It determines the path through which the data is to be transmitted.
"Data Encapsulation and Formatting: An IP protocol accepts the data from the transport layer protocol. An IP protocol ensures that the data is sent and received securely, it encapsulates the data into message known as IP datagram."
"Fragmentation and Reassembly: The limit imposed on the size of the IP datagram by data link layer protocol is known as Maximum Transmission unit (MTU). If the size of IP datagram is greater than the MTU unit, then the IP protocol splits the datagram into smaller units so that they can travel over the local network. Fragmentation can be done by the sender or intermediate router. At the receiver side, all the fragments are reassembled to form an original message."
"Routing: When IP datagram is sent over the same local network such as LAN, MAN, WAN, it is known as direct delivery. When source and destination are on the distant network, then the IP datagram is sent indirectly. This can be accomplished by routing the IP datagram through various devices such as routers."
ARP is a network layer protocol which is used to find the physical address from the IP address.
"The two terms are mainly associated with the ARP Protocol:

ARP request: When a sender wants to know the physical address of the device, it broadcasts the ARP request to the network.
ARP reply: Every device attached to the network will accept the ARP request and process the request, but only recipient recognize the IP address and sends back its physical address in the form of ARP reply. The recipient adds the physical address both to its cache memory and to the datagram header"
"ARP request: When a sender wants to know the physical address of the device, it broadcasts the ARP request to the network."
"ARP reply: Every device attached to the network will accept the ARP request and process the request, but only recipient recognize the IP address and sends back its physical address in the form of ARP reply. The recipient adds the physical address both to its cache memory and to the datagram header"
It is a mechanism used by the hosts or routers to send notifications regarding datagram problems back to the sender.
"A datagram travels from router-to-router until it reaches its destination. If a router is unable to route the data because of some unusual conditions such as disabled links, a device is on fire or network congestion, then the ICMP protocol is used to inform the sender that the datagram is undeliverable."
"An ICMP protocol mainly uses two terms:

ICMP Test: ICMP Test is used to test whether the destination is reachable or not.
ICMP Reply: ICMP Reply is used to check whether the destination device is responding or not."
ICMP Test: ICMP Test is used to test whether the destination is reachable or not.
ICMP Reply: ICMP Reply is used to check whether the destination device is responding or not.
"The core responsibility of the ICMP protocol is to report the problems, not correct them. The responsibility of the correction lies with the sender."
"ICMP can send the messages only to the source, but not to the intermediate routers because the IP datagram carries the addresses of the source and destination but not of the router that it is passed to."
"The transport layer is responsible for the reliability, flow control, and correction of data which is being sent over the network."
The two protocols used in the transport layer are User Datagram protocol and Transmission control protocol.
"User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

It provides connectionless service and end-to-end delivery of transmission.
It is an unreliable protocol as it discovers the errors but not specify the error.
User Datagram Protocol discovers the error, and ICMP protocol reports the error to the sender that user datagram has been damaged.
UDP consists of the following fields:
Source port address: The source port address is the address of the application program that has created the message.
Destination port address: The destination port address is the address of the application program that receives the message.
Total length: It defines the total number of bytes of the user datagram in bytes.
Checksum: The checksum is a 16-bit field used in error detection.
UDP does not specify which packet is lost. UDP contains only checksum; it does not contain any ID of a data segment."

"User Datagram Protocol discovers the error, and ICMP protocol reports the error to the sender that user datagram has been damaged."
"UDP consists of the following fields:

Destination port address: The destination port address is the address of the application program that receives the message.

Checksum: The checksum is a 16-bit field used in error detection."
UDP does not specify which packet is lost. UDP contains only checksum; it does not contain any ID of a data segment.
"Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

It provides a full transport layer services to applications.
It creates a virtual circuit between the sender and receiver, and it is active for the duration of the transmission.
TCP is a reliable protocol as it detects the error and retransmits the damaged frames. Therefore, it ensures all the segments must be received and acknowledged before the transmission is considered to be completed and a virtual circuit is discarded.
At the sending end, TCP divides the whole message into smaller units known as segment, and each segment contains a sequence number which is required for reordering the frames to form an original message.
At the receiving end, TCP collects all the segments and reorders them based on sequence numbers."
"It creates a virtual circuit between the sender and receiver, and it is active for the duration of the transmission."
"TCP is a reliable protocol as it detects the error and retransmits the damaged frames. Therefore, it ensures all the segments must be received and acknowledged before the transmission is considered to be completed and a virtual circuit is discarded."
"At the sending end, TCP divides the whole message into smaller units known as segment, and each segment contains a sequence number which is required for reordering the frames to form an original message."
"At the receiving end, TCP collects all the segments and reorders them based on sequence numbers."
An application layer is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model.
"It is responsible for handling high-level protocols, issues of representation."
This layer allows the user to interact with the application.
"When one application layer protocol wants to communicate with another application layer, it forwards its data to the transport layer."
There is an ambiguity occurs in the application layer. Every application cannot be placed inside the application layer except those who interact with the communication system. For example: text editor cannot be considered in application layer while web browser using HTTP protocol to interact with the network where HTTP protocol is an application layer protocol.
"HTTP: HTTP stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. This protocol allows us to access the data over the world wide web. It transfers the data in the form of plain text, audio, video. It is known as a Hypertext transfer protocol as it has the efficiency to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another."
SNMP: SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is a framework used for managing the devices on the internet by using the TCP/IP protocol suite.
SMTP: SMTP stands for Simple mail transfer protocol. The TCP/IP protocol that supports the e-mail is known as a Simple mail transfer protocol. This protocol is used to send the data to another e-mail address.
"DNS: DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. But, people prefer to use the names instead of addresses. Therefore, the system that maps the name to the address is known as Domain Name System."
TELNET: It is an abbreviation for Terminal Network. It establishes the connection between the local computer and remote computer in such a way that the local terminal appears to be a terminal at the remote system.
FTP: FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a standard internet protocol used for transmitting the files from one computer to another computer.
"Data can be represented either in analog or digital form. The computers used the digital form to store the information. Therefore, the data needs to be converted in digital form so that it can be used by a computer."
"Digital-to-digital encoding is the representation of digital information by a digital signal. When binary 1s and 0s generated by the computer are translated into a sequence of voltage pulses that can be propagated over a wire, this process is known as digital-to-digital encoding."
Digital transmission system sends the voltage pulses over the medium link such as wire or cable.
"In most types of encoding, one voltage level represents 0, and another voltage level represents 1."
The polarity of each pulse determines whether it is positive or negative.
This type of encoding is known as Unipolar encoding as it uses only one polarity.
"In Unipolar encoding, the polarity is assigned to the 1 binary state."
"In this, 1s are represented as a positive value and 0s are represented as a zero value."
"In Unipolar Encoding, '1' is considered as a high voltage and '0' is considered as a zero voltage."
Unipolar encoding has two problems that make this scheme less desirable:
"Polar encoding is an encoding scheme that uses two voltage levels: one is positive, and another is negative."
"By using two voltage levels, an average voltage level is reduced, and the DC component problem of unipolar encoding scheme is alleviated."
"In NRZ encoding, the level of the signal can be represented either positive or negative."
"NRZ-L: In NRZ-L encoding, the level of the signal depends on the type of the bit that it represents. If a bit is 0 or 1, then their voltages will be positive and negative respectively. Therefore, we can say that the level of the signal is dependent on the state of the bit."
"NRZ-I: NRZ-I is an inversion of the voltage level that represents 1 bit. In the NRZ-I encoding scheme, a transition occurs between the positive and negative voltage that represents 1 bit. In this scheme, 0 bit represents no change and 1 bit represents a change in voltage level."
"There must be a signal change for each bit to achieve synchronization. However, to change with every bit, we need to have three values: positive, negative and zero."
"RZ is an encoding scheme that provides three values, positive voltage represents 1, the negative voltage represents 0, and zero voltage represents none."
"In the RZ scheme, halfway through each interval, the signal returns to zero."
"In RZ scheme, 1 bit is represented by positive-to-zero and 0 bit is represented by negative-to-zero."
It performs two signal changes to encode one bit that acquires more bandwidth.
Biphase is an encoding scheme in which signal changes at the middle of the bit interval but does not return to zero.
It changes the signal at the middle of the bit interval but does not return to zero for synchronization.
"In Manchester encoding, a negative-to-positive transition represents binary 1, and positive-to-negative transition represents 0."
Manchester has the same level of synchronization as RZ scheme except that it has two levels of amplitude.
"It changes the signal at the middle of the bit interval for synchronization, but the presence or absence of the transition at the beginning of the interval determines the bit. A transition means binary 0 and no transition means binary 1."
"In Manchester Encoding scheme, two signal changes represent 0 and one signal change represent 1."
"Bipolar encoding scheme represents three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero."
"In Bipolar encoding scheme, zero level represents binary 0, and binary 1 is represented by alternating positive and negative voltages."
"If the first 1 bit is represented by positive amplitude, then the second 1 bit is represented by negative voltage, third 1 bit is represented by the positive amplitude and so on. This alternation can also occur even when the 1bits are not consecutive."
"AMI stands for alternate mark inversion where mark work comes from telegraphy which means 1. So, it can be redefined as alternate 1 inversion."
"In Bipolar AMI encoding scheme, 0 bit is represented by zero level and 1 bit is represented by alternating positive and negative voltages."
This encoding scheme does not ensure the synchronization of a long string of 0s bits.
This technique is adopted in North America to provide synchronization of a long sequence of 0s bits.
"In most of the cases, the functionality of B8ZS is similar to the bipolar AMI, but the only difference is that it provides the synchronization when a long sequence of 0s bits occur."
"B8ZS ensures synchronization of a long string of 0s by providing force artificial signal changes called violations, within 0 string pattern."
"When eight 0 occurs, then B8ZS implements some changes in 0s string pattern based on the polarity of the previous 1 bit."
"If the polarity of the previous 1 bit is positive, the eight 0s will be encoded as zero, zero, zero, positive, negative, zero, negative, positive."
"If the polarity of previous 1 bit is negative, then the eight 0s will be encoded as zero, zero, zero, negative, positive, zero, positive, negative."
HDB3 technique is designed to provide the synchronization of a long sequence of 0s bits.
"In the HDB3 technique, the pattern of violation is based on the polarity of the previous bit."
"When four 0s occur, HDB3 looks at the number of 1s bits occurred since the last substitution."
"If the number of 1s bits is odd, then the violation is made on the fourth consecutive of 0. If the polarity of the previous bit is positive, then the violation is positive. If the polarity of the previous bit is negative, then the violation is negative."
If the number of 1s bits since the last substitution is odd.
"If the number of 1s bits is even, then the violation is made on the place of the first and fourth consecutive 0s. If the polarity of the previous bit is positive, then violations are negative, and if the polarity of the previous bit is negative, then violations are positive."
If the number of 1s bits since the last substitution is even.
"When an analog signal is digitalized, this is called an analog-to-digital conversion."
"Suppose human sends a voice in the form of an analog signal, we need to digitalize the analog signal which is less prone to noise. It requires a reduction in the number of values in an analog message so that they can be represented in the digital stream."
"In analog-to-digital conversion, the information contained in a continuous wave form is converted in digital pulses."
"PAM technique takes an analog signal, samples it, and generates a series of digital pulses based on the result of sampling where sampling means measuring the amplitude of a signal at equal intervals."
"PAM technique is not useful in data communication as it translates the original wave form into pulses, but these pulses are not digital. To make them digital, PAM technique is modified to PCM technique."
"PCM technique is used to modify the pulses created by PAM to form a digital signal. To achieve this, PCM quantizes PAM pulses. Quantization is a process of assigning integral values in a specific range to sampled instances."
"PCM is made of four separate processes: PAM, quantization, binary encoding, and digital-to-digital encoding."
Transmission media is a communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through the electromagnetic signals.
The main functionality of the transmission media is to carry the information in the form of bits through LAN(Local Area Network).
It is a physical path between transmitter and receiver in data communication.
"In a copper-based network, the bits in the form of electrical signals."
"In a fibre based network, the bits in the form of light pulses."
"In OSI(Open System Interconnection) phase, transmission media supports the Layer 1. Therefore, it is considered to be as a Layer 1 component."
"The electrical signals can be sent through the copper wire, fibre optics, atmosphere, water, and vacuum."
The characteristics and quality of data transmission are determined by the characteristics of medium and signal.
"Transmission media is of two types are wired media and wireless media. In wired media, medium characteristics are more important whereas, in wireless media, signal characteristics are more important."
"Different transmission media have different properties such as bandwidth, delay, cost and ease of installation and maintenance."
"The transmission media is available in the lowest layer of the OSI reference model, i.e., Physical layer."
"Bandwidth: All the factors are remaining constant, the greater the bandwidth of a medium, the higher the data transmission rate of a signal."
Transmission impairment: When the received signal is not identical to the transmitted one due to the transmission impairment. The quality of the signals will get destroyed due to transmission impairment.
Interference: An interference is defined as the process of disrupting a signal when it travels over a communication medium on the addition of some unwanted signal.
"Attenuation: Attenuation means the loss of energy, i.e., the strength of the signal decreases with increasing the distance which causes the loss of energy."
"Distortion: Distortion occurs when there is a change in the shape of the signal. This type of distortion is examined from different signals having different frequencies. Each frequency component has its own propagation speed, so they reach at a different time which leads to the delay distortion."
"Noise: When data is travelled over a transmission medium, some unwanted signal is added to it which creates the noise."
It is defined as the physical medium through which the signals are transmitted. It is also known as Bounded media.
"Twisted pair is a physical media made up of a pair of cables twisted with each other. A twisted pair cable is cheap as compared to other transmission media. Installation of the twisted pair cable is easy, and it is a lightweight cable. The frequency range for twisted pair cable is from 0 to 3.5KHz."
A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern.
The degree of reduction in noise interference is determined by the number of turns per foot. Increasing the number of turns per foot decreases noise interference.
An unshielded twisted pair is widely used in telecommunication. Following are the categories of the unshielded twisted pair cable:
Category 1: Category 1 is used for telephone lines that have low-speed data.
"Category 4: It can support upto 20Mbps. Therefore, it can be used for long-distance communication."
This cable can only be used for shorter distances because of attenuation.
A shielded twisted pair is a cable that contains the mesh surrounding the wire that allows the higher transmission rate.
The cost of the shielded twisted pair cable is not very high and not very low.
It has higher capacity as compared to unshielded twisted pair cable.
It is shielded that provides the higher data transmission rate.
It is more expensive as compared to UTP and coaxial cable.
"Coaxial cable is very commonly used transmission media, for example, TV wire is usually a coaxial cable."
The name of the cable is coaxial as it contains two conductors parallel to each other.
It has a higher frequency as compared to Twisted pair cable.
"The inner conductor of the coaxial cable is made up of copper, and the outer conductor is made up of copper mesh. The middle core is made up of non-conductive cover that separates the inner conductor from the outer conductor."
The middle core is responsible for the data transferring whereas the copper mesh prevents from the EMI(Electromagnetic interference).
Baseband transmission: It is defined as the process of transmitting a single signal at high speed.
Broadband transmission: It is defined as the process of transmitting multiple signals simultaneously.
It has better shielding as compared to twisted pair cable.
It is more expensive as compared to twisted pair cable.
If any fault occurs in the cable causes the failure in the entire network.
Fibre optic cable is a cable that uses electrical signals for communication.
Fibre optic is a cable that holds the optical fibres coated in plastic that are used to send the data by pulses of light.
"The plastic coating protects the optical fibres from heat, cold, electromagnetic interference from other types of wiring."
"Core: The optical fibre consists of a narrow strand of glass or plastic known as a core. A core is a light transmission area of the fibre. The more the area of the core, the more light will be transmitted into the fibre."
Cladding: The concentric layer of glass is known as cladding. The main functionality of the cladding is to provide the lower refractive index at the core interface as to cause the reflection within the core so that the light waves are transmitted through the fibre.
"Jacket: The protective coating consisting of plastic is known as a jacket. The main purpose of a jacket is to preserve the fibre strength, absorb shock and extra fibre protection."
Following are the advantages of fibre optic cable over copper:
"Greater Bandwidth: The fibre optic cable provides more bandwidth as compared copper. Therefore, the fibre optic carries more data as compared to copper cable."
Faster speed: Fibre optic cable carries the data in the form of light. This allows the fibre optic cable to carry the signals at a higher speed.
Longer distances: The fibre optic cable carries the data at a longer distance as compared to copper cable.
Better reliability: The fibre optic cable is more reliable than the copper cable as it is immune to any temperature changes while it can cause obstruct in the connectivity of copper cable.
Thinner and Sturdier: Fibre optic cable is thinner and lighter in weight so it can withstand more pull pressure than copper cable.
An unguided transmission transmits the electromagnetic waves without using any physical medium. Therefore it is also known as wireless transmission.
"In unguided media, air is the media through which the electromagnetic energy can flow easily."
Radio waves are the electromagnetic waves that are transmitted in all the directions of free space.
"Radio waves are omnidirectional, i.e., the signals are propagated in all the directions."
The range in frequencies of radio waves is from 3Khz to 1 khz.
"In the case of radio waves, the sending and receiving antenna are not aligned, i.e., the wave sent by the sending antenna can be received by any receiving antenna."
A Radio wave is useful for multicasting when there is one sender and many receivers.
"An FM radio, television, cordless phones are examples of a radio wave."
Radio transmission is mainly used for wide area networks and mobile cellular phones.
"Radio waves cover a large area, and they can penetrate the walls."
Terrestrial Microwave transmission is a technology that transmits the focused beam of a radio signal from one ground-based microwave transmission antenna to another.
Microwaves are the electromagnetic waves having the frequency in the range from 1GHz to 1000 GHz.
"Microwaves are unidirectional as the sending and receiving antenna is to be aligned, i.e., the waves sent by the sending antenna are narrowly focussed."
"In this case, antennas are mounted on the towers to send a beam to another antenna which is km away."
"It works on the line of sight transmission, i.e., the antennas mounted on the towers are the direct sight of each other."
Frequency range: The frequency range of terrestrial microwave is from 4-6 GHz to 21-23 GHz.
Bandwidth: It supports the bandwidth from 1 to 10 Mbps.
Long distance: It is expensive as it requires a higher tower for a longer distance.
Attenuation: Attenuation means loss of signal. It is affected by environmental conditions and antenna size.
It is free from land acquisition as it does not require any land for the installation of cables.
Microwave transmission provides an easy communication in terrains as the installation of cable in terrain is quite a difficult task.
Communication over oceans can be achieved by using microwave transmission.
Eavesdropping: An eavesdropping creates insecure communication. Any malicious user can catch the signal in the air by using its own antenna.
Out of phase signal: A signal can be moved out of phase by using microwave transmission.
"Susceptible to weather condition: A microwave transmission is susceptible to weather condition. This means that any environmental change such as rain, wind can distort the signal."
Bandwidth limited: Allocation of bandwidth is limited in the case of microwave transmission.
A satellite is a physical object that revolves around the earth at a known height.
Satellite communication is more reliable nowadays as it offers more flexibility than cable and fibre optic systems.
We can communicate with any point on the globe by using satellite communication.
"The satellite accepts the signal that is transmitted from the earth station, and it amplifies the signal. The amplified signal is retransmitted to another earth station."
The coverage area of a satellite microwave is more than the terrestrial microwave.
The transmission cost of the satellite is independent of the distance from the centre of the coverage area.
Satellite communication is used in mobile and wireless communication applications.
"It is used in a wide variety of applications such as weather forecasting, radio/TV signal broadcasting, mobile communication, etc."
Satellite designing and development requires more time and higher cost.
The Satellite needs to be monitored and controlled on regular periods so that it remains in orbit.
"The life of the satellite is about 12-15 years. Due to this reason, another launch of the satellite has to be planned before it becomes non-functional."
An infrared transmission is a wireless technology used for communication over short ranges.
The frequency of the infrared in the range from 300 GHz to 400 THz.
"It is used for short-range communication such as data transfer between two cell phones, TV remote operation, data transfer between a computer and cell phone resides in the same closed area."
"It supports high bandwidth, and hence the data rate will be very high."
"Infrared waves cannot penetrate the walls. Therefore, the infrared communication in one room cannot be interrupted by the nearby rooms."
Infrared communication is unreliable outside the building because the sun rays will interfere with the infrared waves.
Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple data streams over a single medium. The process of combining the data streams is known as multiplexing and hardware used for multiplexing is known as a multiplexer.
"Multiplexing is achieved by using a device called Multiplexer (MUX) that combines n input lines to generate a single output line. Multiplexing follows many-to-one, i.e., n input lines and one output line."
"Demultiplexing is achieved by using a device called Demultiplexer (DEMUX) available at the receiving end. DEMUX separates a signal into its component signals (one input and n outputs). Therefore, we can say that demultiplexing follows the one-to-many approach."
The transmission medium is used to send the signal from sender to receiver. The medium can only have one signal at a time.
"If there are multiple signals to share one medium, then the medium must be divided in such a way that each signal is given some portion of the available bandwidth. For example: If there are 10 signals and bandwidth of medium is100 units, then the 10 unit is shared by each signal."
"When multiple signals share the common medium, there is a possibility of collision. Multiplexing concept is used to avoid such collision."
Multiplexing technique is widely used in telecommunications in which several telephone calls are carried through a single wire.
Multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the early 1870s and is now widely used in communication.
George Owen Squier developed the telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.
The 'n' input lines are transmitted through a multiplexer and multiplexer combines the signals to form a composite signal.
The composite signal is passed through a Demultiplexer and demultiplexer separates a signal to component signals and transfers them to their respective destinations.
More than one signal can be sent over a single medium.
Frequency Division Multiplexing is a technique in which the available bandwidth of a single transmission medium is subdivided into several channels.
"In the above diagram, a single transmission medium is subdivided into several frequency channels, and each frequency channel is given to different devices. Device 1 has a frequency channel of range from 1 to 5."
"The input signals are translated into frequency bands by using modulation techniques, and they are combined by a multiplexer to form a composite signal."
The main aim of the FDM is to subdivide the available bandwidth into different frequency channels and allocate them to different devices.
"Using the modulation technique, the input signals are transmitted into frequency bands and then combined to form a composite signal."
"The carriers which are used for modulating the signals are known as sub-carriers. They are represented as f1,f2..fn."
FDM is mainly used in radio broadcasts and TV networks.
A Large number of signals can be sent through an FDM simultaneously.
It does not require any synchronization between sender and receiver.
FDM technique is used only when low-speed channels are required.
"It is used in FM and AM broadcasting. Each FM radio station has different frequencies, and they are multiplexed to form a composite signal. The multiplexed signal is transmitted in the air."
Wavelength Division Multiplexing is same as FDM except that the optical signals are transmitted through the fibre optic cable.
WDM is used on fibre optics to increase the capacity of a single fibre.
It is used to utilize the high data rate capability of fibre optic cable.
Optical signals from different source are combined to form a wider band of light with the help of multiplexer.
"At the receiving end, demultiplexer separates the signals to transmit them to their respective destinations."
Multiplexing and Demultiplexing can be achieved by using a prism.
"Prism can perform a role of multiplexer by combining the various optical signals to form a composite signal, and the composite signal is transmitted through a fibre optical cable."
"Prism also performs a reverse operation, i.e., demultiplexing the signal."
"In Frequency Division Multiplexing Technique, all signals operate at the same time with different frequency, but in case of Time Division Multiplexing technique, all signals operate at the same frequency with different time."
"In Time Division Multiplexing technique, the total time available in the channel is distributed among different users. Therefore, each user is allocated with different time interval known as a Time slot at which data is to be transmitted by the sender."
A user takes control of the channel for a fixed amount of time.
"In Time Division Multiplexing technique, data is not transmitted simultaneously rather the data is transmitted one-by-one."
"In TDM, the signal is transmitted in the form of frames. Frames contain a cycle of time slots in which each frame contains one or more slots dedicated to each user."
It can be used to multiplex both digital and analog signals but mainly used to multiplex digital signals.
A Synchronous TDM is a technique in which time slot is preassigned to every device.
"In Synchronous TDM, each device is given some time slot irrespective of the fact that the device contains the data or not."
"If the device does not have any data, then the slot will remain empty."
"In Synchronous TDM, signals are sent in the form of frames. Time slots are organized in the form of frames. If a device does not have data for a particular time slot, then the empty slot will be transmitted."
"The most popular Synchronous TDM are T-1 multiplexing, ISDN multiplexing, and SONET multiplexing."
"If there are n devices, then there are n slots."
"In the above figure, the Synchronous TDM technique is implemented. Each device is allocated with some time slot. The time slots are transmitted irrespective of whether the sender has data to send or not."
"The capacity of the channel is not fully utilized as the empty slots are also transmitted which is having no data. In the above figure, the first frame is completely filled, but in the last two frames, some slots are empty. Therefore, we can say that the capacity of the channel is not utilized efficiently."
The speed of the transmission medium should be greater than the total speed of the input lines. An alternative approach to the Synchronous TDM is Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing.
"An asynchronous TDM is a technique in which time slots are not fixed as in the case of Synchronous TDM. Time slots are allocated to only those devices which have the data to send. Therefore, we can say that Asynchronous Time Division multiplexor transmits only the data from active workstations."
An asynchronous TDM technique dynamically allocates the time slots to the devices.
"In Asynchronous TDM, total speed of the input lines can be greater than the capacity of the channel."
Asynchronous Time Division multiplexor accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame that contains only data with no empty slots.
"In Asynchronous TDM, each slot contains an address part that identifies the source of the data."
"The difference between Asynchronous TDM and Synchronous TDM is that many slots in Synchronous TDM are unutilized, but in Asynchronous TDM, slots are fully utilized. This leads to the smaller transmission time and efficient utilization of the capacity of the channel."
"In Synchronous TDM, if there are n sending devices, then there are n time slots. In Asynchronous TDM, if there are n sending devices, then there are m time slots where m is less than n (m<n)."
The number of slots in a frame depends on the statistical analysis of the number of input lines.
"In the above diagram, there are 4 devices, but only two devices are sending the data, i.e., A and C. Therefore, the data of A and C are only transmitted through the transmission line."
The above figure shows that the data part contains the address to determine the source of the data.
"When a user accesses the internet or another computer network outside their immediate location, messages are sent through the network of transmission media. This technique of transferring the information from one computer network to another network is known as switching."
Switching in a computer network is achieved by using switches. A switch is a small hardware device which is used to join multiple computers together with one local area network (LAN).
Network switches operate at layer 2 (Data link layer) in the OSI model.
Switching is transparent to the user and does not require any configuration in the home network.
Switches are used to forward the packets based on MAC addresses.
A Switch is used to transfer the data only to the device that has been addressed. It verifies the destination address to route the packet appropriately.
Packet collision is minimum as it directly communicates between source and destination.
It does not broadcast the message as it works with limited bandwidth.
"Bandwidth: It is defined as the maximum transfer rate of a cable. It is a very critical and expensive resource. Therefore, switching techniques are used for the effective utilization of the bandwidth of a network."
"Collision: Collision is the effect that occurs when more than one device transmits the message over the same physical media, and they collide with each other. To overcome this problem, switching technology is implemented so that packets do not collide with each other."
It reduces the workload on individual PCs as it sends the information to only that device which has been addressed.
It increases the overall performance of the network by reducing the traffic on the network.
There will be less frame collision as switch creates the collision domain for each connection.
Proper designing and configuration of the switch are required to handle multicast packets.
"The layer 2 switches are used for transmitting the data on the data link layer, and it also performs error checking on transmitted and received frames."
The layer 2 switches forward the packets with the help of MAC address.
Different modes are used for forwarding the packets known as Switching modes.
"In switching mode, Different parts of a frame are recognized. The frame consists of several parts such as preamble, destination MAC address, source MAC address, user's data, FCS."
Store-and-forward is a technique in which the intermediate nodes store the received frame and then check for errors before forwarding the packets to the next node.
"The layer 2 switch waits until the entire frame has received. On receiving the entire frame, switch store the frame into the switch buffer memory. This process is known as storing the frame."
"When the frame is stored, then the frame is checked for the errors. If any error found, the message is discarded otherwise the message is forwarded to the next node. This process is known as forwarding the frame."
CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) technique is implemented that uses a number of bits to check for the errors on the received frame.
The store-and-forward technique ensures a high level of security as the destination network will not be affected by the corrupted frames.
Store-and-forward switches are highly reliable as it does not forward the collided frames.
Cut-through switching is a technique in which the switch forwards the packets after the destination address has been identified without waiting for the entire frame to be received.
"Once the frame is received, it checks the first six bytes of the frame following the preamble, the switch checks the destination in the switching table to determine the outgoing interface port, and forwards the frame to the destination."
It has low latency rate as the switch does not wait for the entire frame to be received before sending the packets to the destination.
"It has no error checking technique. Therefore, the errors can be sent with or without errors to the receiver."
A Cut-through switching technique has low wait time as it forwards the packets as soon as it identifies the destination MAC address.
"In this technique, collision is not detected, if frames have collided will also be forwarded."
A Fragment-free switching is an advanced technique of the Cut-through Switching.
A Fragment-free switching is a technique that reads atleast 64 bytes of a frame before forwarding to the next node to provide the error-free transmission.
It combines the speed of Cut-through Switching with the error checking functionality.
This technique checks the 64 bytes of the ethernet frame where addressing information is available.
"A collision is detected within 64 bytes of the frame, the frames which are collided will not be forwarded further."
"In large networks, there can be multiple paths from sender to receiver. The switching technique will decide the best route for data transmission."
Switching technique is used to connect the systems for making one-to-one communication.
Circuit switching is a switching technique that establishes a dedicated path between sender and receiver.
"In the Circuit Switching Technique, once the connection is established then the dedicated path will remain to exist until the connection is terminated."
Circuit switching in a network operates in a similar way as the telephone works.
A complete end-to-end path must exist before the communication takes place.
"In case of circuit switching technique, when any user wants to send the data, voice, video, a request signal is sent to the receiver then the receiver sends back the acknowledgment to ensure the availability of the dedicated path. After receiving the acknowledgment, dedicated path transfers the data."
Circuit switching is used in public telephone network. It is used for voice transmission.
Fixed data can be transferred at a time in circuit switching technology.
Space Division Switching is a circuit switching technology in which a single transmission path is accomplished in a switch by using a physically separate set of crosspoints.
Space Division Switching can be achieved by using crossbar switch. A crossbar switch is a metallic crosspoint or semiconductor gate that can be enabled or disabled by a control unit.
"The Crossbar switch is made by using the semiconductor. For example, Xilinx crossbar switch using FPGAs."
"Space Division Switching has high speed, high capacity, and nonblocking switches."
The Crossbar switch is a switch that has n input lines and n output lines. The crossbar switch has n2 intersection points known as crosspoints.
"The number of crosspoints increases as the number of stations is increased. Therefore, it becomes very expensive for a large switch. The solution to this is to use a multistage switch."
Multistage Switch is made by splitting the crossbar switch into the smaller units and then interconnecting them.
"If one path fails, then there will be an availability of another path."
"In the case of Circuit Switching technique, the communication channel is dedicated."
"Once the dedicated path is established, the only delay occurs in the speed of data transmission."
It takes a long time to establish a connection approx 10 seconds during which no data can be transmitted.
It is more expensive than other switching techniques as a dedicated path is required for each connection.
"It is inefficient to use because once the path is established and no data is transferred, then the capacity of the path is wasted."
"In this case, the connection is dedicated therefore no other data can be transferred even if the channel is free."
Message Switching is a switching technique in which a message is transferred as a complete unit and routed through intermediate nodes at which it is stored and forwarded.
"In Message Switching technique, there is no establishment of a dedicated path between the sender and receiver."
The destination address is appended to the message. Message Switching provides a dynamic routing as the message is routed through the intermediate nodes based on the information available in the message.
Message switches are programmed in such a way so that they can provide the most efficient routes.
Each and every node stores the entire message and then forward it to the next node. This type of network is known as store and forward network.
Data channels are shared among the communicating devices that improve the efficiency of using available bandwidth.
Traffic congestion can be reduced because the message is temporarily stored in the nodes.
"The size of the message which is sent over the network can be varied. Therefore, it supports the data of unlimited size."
The message switches must be equipped with sufficient storage to enable them to store the messages until the message is forwarded.
The Long delay can occur due to the storing and forwarding facility provided by the message switching technique.
"The packet switching is a switching technique in which the message is sent in one go, but it is divided into smaller pieces, and they are sent individually."
The message splits into smaller pieces known as packets and packets are given a unique number to identify their order at the receiving end.
"Every packet contains some information in its headers such as source address, destination address and sequence number."
"Packets will travel across the network, taking the shortest path as possible."
All the packets are reassembled at the receiving end in correct order.
"If any packet is missing or corrupted, then the message will be sent to resend the message."
"If the correct order of the packets is reached, then the acknowledgment message will be sent."
"It is a packet switching technology in which packet is known as a datagram, is considered as an independent entity. Each packet contains the information about the destination and switch uses this information to forward the packet to the correct destination."
The packets are reassembled at the receiving end in correct order.
"In Datagram Packet Switching technique, the path is not fixed."
Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the packets.
"In the case of Virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is established before the messages are sent."
Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.
"In this case, the path is fixed for the duration of a logical connection."
Let's understand the concept of virtual circuit switching through a diagram:
"In the above diagram, A and B are the sender and receiver respectively. 1 and 2 are the nodes."
Call request and call accept packets are used to establish a connection between the sender and receiver.
"After transmission of data, an acknowledgment signal is sent by the receiver that the message has been received."
"If the user wants to terminate the connection, a clear signal is sent for the termination."
"Cost-effective: In packet switching technique, switching devices do not require massive secondary storage to store the packets, so cost is minimized to some extent. Therefore, we can say that the packet switching technique is a cost-effective technique."
"Reliable: If any node is busy, then the packets can be rerouted. This ensures that the Packet Switching technique provides reliable communication."
"Efficient: Packet Switching is an efficient technique. It does not require any established path prior to the transmission, and many users can use the same communication channel simultaneously, hence makes use of available bandwidth very efficiently."
Packet Switching technique cannot be implemented in those applications that require low delay and high-quality services.
The protocols used in a packet switching technique are very complex and requires high implementation cost.
"If the network is overloaded or corrupted, then it requires retransmission of lost packets. It can also lead to the loss of critical information if errors are nor recovered."
"In the OSI model, the data link layer is a 4th layer from the top and 2nd layer from the bottom."
"The communication channel that connects the adjacent nodes is known as links, and in order to move the datagram from source to the destination, the datagram must be moved across an individual link."
The main responsibility of the Data Link Layer is to transfer the datagram across an individual link.
"The Data link layer protocol defines the format of the packet exchanged across the nodes as well as the actions such as Error detection, retransmission, flow control, and random access."
"The Data Link Layer protocols are Ethernet, token ring, FDDI and PPP."
"An important characteristic of a Data Link Layer is that datagram can be handled by different link layer protocols on different links in a path. For example, the datagram is handled by Ethernet on the first link, PPP on the second link."
Framing & Link access: Data Link Layer protocols encapsulate each network frame within a Link layer frame before the transmission across the link. A frame consists of a data field in which network layer datagram is inserted and a number of data fields. It specifies the structure of the frame as well as a channel access protocol by which frame is to be transmitted over the link.
"Reliable delivery: Data Link Layer provides a reliable delivery service, i.e., transmits the network layer datagram without any error. A reliable delivery service is accomplished with transmissions and acknowledgements. A data link layer mainly provides the reliable delivery service over the links as they have higher error rates and they can be corrected locally, link at which an error occurs rather than forcing to retransmit the data."
"Flow control: A receiving node can receive the frames at a faster rate than it can process the frame. Without flow control, the receiver's buffer can overflow, and frames can get lost. To overcome this problem, the data link layer uses the flow control to prevent the sending node on one side of the link from overwhelming the receiving node on another side of the link."
Error detection: Errors can be introduced by signal attenuation and noise. Data Link Layer protocol provides a mechanism to detect one or more errors. This is achieved by adding error detection bits in the frame and then receiving node can perform an error check.
"Error correction: Error correction is similar to the Error detection, except that receiving node not only detect the errors but also determine where the errors have occurred in the frame."
"Half-Duplex & Full-Duplex: In a Full-Duplex mode, both the nodes can transmit the data at the same time. In a Half-Duplex mode, only one node can transmit the data at the same time."
"When data is transmitted from one device to another device, the system does not guarantee whether the data received by the device is identical to the data transmitted by another device. An Error is a situation when the message received at the receiver end is not identical to the message transmitted."
The only one bit of a given data unit is changed from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1.
"In the above figure, the message which is sent is corrupted as single-bit, i.e., 0 bit is changed to 1."
"Single-Bit Error does not appear more likely in Serial Data Transmission. For example, Sender sends the data at 10 Mbps, this means that the bit lasts only for 1 ?s and for a single-bit error to occurred, a noise must be more than 1 ?s."
"Single-Bit Error mainly occurs in Parallel Data Transmission. For example, if eight wires are used to send the eight bits of a byte, if one of the wire is noisy, then single-bit is corrupted per byte."
The two or more bits are changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 is known as Burst Error.
The Burst Error is determined from the first corrupted bit to the last corrupted bit.
The duration of noise in Burst Error is more than the duration of noise in Single-Bit.
Burst Errors are most likely to occurr in Serial Data Transmission.
The number of affected bits depends on the duration of the noise and data rate.
Single Parity checking is the simple mechanism and inexpensive to detect the errors.
"In this technique, a redundant bit is also known as a parity bit which is appended at the end of the data unit so that the number of 1s becomes even. Therefore, the total number of transmitted bits would be 9 bits."
"If the number of 1s bits is odd, then parity bit 1 is appended and if the number of 1s bits is even, then parity bit 0 is appended at the end of the data unit."
"At the receiving end, the parity bit is calculated from the received data bits and compared with the received parity bit."
"This technique generates the total number of 1s even, so it is known as even-parity checking."
It can only detect single-bit errors which are very rare.
"If two bits are interchanged, then it cannot detect the errors."
Performance can be improved by using Two-Dimensional Parity Check which organizes the data in the form of a table.
"Parity check bits are computed for each row, which is equivalent to the single-parity check."
"In Two-Dimensional Parity check, a block of bits is divided into rows, and the redundant row of bits is added to the whole block."
"At the receiving end, the parity bits are compared with the parity bits computed from the received data."
"If two bits in one data unit are corrupted and two bits exactly the same position in another data unit are also corrupted, then 2D Parity checker will not be able to detect the error."
This technique cannot be used to detect the 4-bit errors or more in some cases.
A Checksum is an error detection technique based on the concept of redundancy.
"A Checksum is generated at the sending side. Checksum generator subdivides the data into equal segments of n bits each, and all these segments are added together by using one's complement arithmetic. The sum is complemented and appended to the original data, known as checksum field. The extended data is transmitted across the network."
"Suppose L is the total sum of the data segments, then the checksum would be ?L"
"A Checksum is verified at the receiving side. The receiver subdivides the incoming data into equal segments of n bits each, and all these segments are added together, and then this sum is complemented. If the complement of the sum is zero, then the data is accepted otherwise data is rejected."
CRC is a redundancy error technique used to determine the error.
Following are the steps used in CRC for error detection:
"In CRC technique, a string of n 0s is appended to the data unit, and this n number is less than the number of bits in a predetermined number, known as division which is n+1 bits."
"Secondly, the newly extended data is divided by a divisor using a process is known as binary division. The remainder generated from this division is known as CRC remainder."
"Thirdly, the CRC remainder replaces the appended 0s at the end of the original data. This newly generated unit is sent to the receiver."
"The receiver receives the data followed by the CRC remainder. The receiver will treat this whole unit as a single unit, and it is divided by the same divisor that was used to find the CRC remainder."
"If the resultant of this division is zero which means that it has no error, and the data is accepted."
"If the resultant of this division is not zero which means that the data consists of an error. Therefore, the data is discarded."
Suppose the original data is 11100 and divisor is 1001.
"A CRC generator uses a modulo-2 division. Firstly, three zeroes are appended at the end of the data as the length of the divisor is 4 and we know that the length of the string 0s to be appended is always one less than the length of the divisor."
"Now, the string becomes 11100000, and the resultant string is divided by the divisor 1001."
The remainder generated from the binary division is known as CRC remainder. The generated value of the CRC remainder is 111.
"CRC remainder replaces the appended string of 0s at the end of the data unit, and the final string would be 11100111 which is sent across the network."
The functionality of the CRC checker is similar to the CRC generator.
"When the string 11100111 is received at the receiving end, then CRC checker performs the modulo-2 division."
"A string is divided by the same divisor, i.e., 1001."
"In this case, CRC checker generates the remainder of zero. Therefore, the data is accepted."
Error Correction codes are used to detect and correct the errors when data is transmitted from the sender to the receiver.
"Backward error correction: Once the error is discovered, the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the entire data unit."
"Forward error correction: In this case, the receiver uses the error-correcting code which automatically corrects the errors."
"A single additional bit can detect the error, but cannot correct it."
"For correcting the errors, one has to know the exact position of the error. For example, If we want to calculate a single-bit error, the error correction code will determine which one of seven bits is in error. To achieve this, we have to add some additional redundant bits."
Suppose r is the number of redundant bits and d is the total number of the data bits. The number of redundant bits r can be calculated by using the formula:
"The value of r is calculated by using the above formula. For example, if the value of d is 4, then the possible smallest value that satisfies the above relation would be 3."
"To determine the position of the bit which is in error, a technique developed by R.W Hamming is Hamming code which can be applied to any length of the data unit and uses the relationship between data units and redundant units."
Parity bits: The bit which is appended to the original data of binary bits so that the total number of 1s is even or odd.
"Even parity: To check for even parity, if the total number of 1s is even, then the value of the parity bit is 0. If the total number of 1s occurrences is odd, then the value of the parity bit is 1."
"Odd Parity: To check for odd parity, if the total number of 1s is even, then the value of parity bit is 1. If the total number of 1s is odd, then the value of parity bit is 0."
An information of 'd' bits are added to the redundant bits 'r' to form d+r.
The location of each of the (d+r) digits is assigned a decimal value.
"At the receiving end, the parity bits are recalculated. The decimal value of the parity bits determines the position of an error."
Let's understand the concept of Hamming code through an example:
Suppose the original data is 1010 which is to be sent.
"The number of redundant bits is 3. The three bits are represented by r1, r2, r4. The position of the redundant bits is calculated with corresponds to the raised power of 2. Therefore, their corresponding positions are 1, 21, 22."
The r1 bit is calculated by performing a parity check on the bit positions whose binary representation includes 1 in the first position.
"We observe from the above figure that the bit positions that includes 1 in the first position are 1, 3, 5, 7. Now, we perform the even-parity check at these bit positions. The total number of 1 at these bit positions corresponding to r1 is even, therefore, the value of the r1 bit is 0."
The r2 bit is calculated by performing a parity check on the bit positions whose binary representation includes 1 in the second position.
"We observe from the above figure that the bit positions that includes 1 in the second position are 2, 3, 6, 7. Now, we perform the even-parity check at these bit positions. The total number of 1 at these bit positions corresponding to r2 is odd, therefore, the value of the r2 bit is 1."
The r4 bit is calculated by performing a parity check on the bit positions whose binary representation includes 1 in the third position.
"We observe from the above figure that the bit positions that includes 1 in the third position are 4, 5, 6, 7. Now, we perform the even-parity check at these bit positions. The total number of 1 at these bit positions corresponding to r4 is even, therefore, the value of the r4 bit is 0."
"Suppose the 4th bit is changed from 0 to 1 at the receiving end, then parity bits are recalculated."
"We observe from the above figure that the binary representation of r1 is 1100. Now, we perform the even-parity check, the total number of 1s appearing in the r1 bit is an even number. Therefore, the value of r1 is 0."
"We observe from the above figure that the binary representation of r2 is 1001. Now, we perform the even-parity check, the total number of 1s appearing in the r2 bit is an even number. Therefore, the value of r2 is 0."
"We observe from the above figure that the binary representation of r4 is 1011. Now, we perform the even-parity check, the total number of 1s appearing in the r4 bit is an odd number. Therefore, the value of r4 is 1."
"The binary representation of redundant bits, i.e., r4r2r1 is 100, and its corresponding decimal value is 4. Therefore, the error occurs in a 4th bit position. The bit value must be changed from 1 to 0 to correct the error."
"Data Link Control is the service provided by the Data Link Layer to provide reliable data transfer over the physical medium. For example, In the half-duplex transmission mode, one device can only transmit the data at a time. If both the devices at the end of the links transmit the data simultaneously, they will collide and leads to the loss of the information. The Data link layer provides the coordination among the devices so that no collision occurs."
"Line Discipline is a functionality of the Data link layer that provides the coordination among the link systems. It determines which device can send, and when it can send the data."
END/ACK stands for Enquiry/Acknowledgement is used when there is no wrong receiver available on the link and having a dedicated path between the two devices so that the device capable of receiving the transmission is the intended one.
END/ACK coordinates which device will start the transmission and whether the recipient is ready or not.
The transmitter transmits the frame called an Enquiry (ENQ) asking whether the receiver is available to receive the data or not.
The receiver responses either with the positive acknowledgement(ACK) or with the negative acknowledgement(NACK) where positive acknowledgement means that the receiver is ready to receive the transmission and negative acknowledgement means that the receiver is unable to accept the transmission.
"If the response to the ENQ is positive, the sender will transmit its data, and once all of its data has been transmitted, the device finishes its transmission with an EOT (END-of-Transmission) frame."
"If the response to the ENQ is negative, then the sender disconnects and restarts the transmission at another time."
"If the response is neither negative nor positive, the sender assumes that the ENQ frame was lost during the transmission and makes three attempts to establish a link before giving up."
"The Poll/Select method of line discipline works with those topologies where one device is designated as a primary station, and other devices are secondary stations."
"In this, the primary device and multiple secondary devices consist of a single transmission line, and all the exchanges are made through the primary device even though the destination is a secondary device."
"The primary device has control over the communication link, and the secondary device follows the instructions of the primary device."
"The primary device determines which device is allowed to use the communication channel. Therefore, we can say that it is an initiator of the session."
"If the primary device wants to receive the data from the secondary device, it asks the secondary device that they anything to send, this process is known as polling."
"If the primary device wants to send some data to the secondary device, then it tells the target secondary to get ready to receive the data, this process is known as selecting."
The select mode is used when the primary device has something to send.
"When the primary device wants to send some data, then it alerts the secondary device for the upcoming transmission by transmitting a Select (SEL) frame, one field of the frame includes the address of the intended secondary device."
"When the secondary device receives the SEL frame, it sends an acknowledgement that indicates the secondary ready status."
"If the secondary device is ready to accept the data, then the primary device sends two or more data frames to the intended secondary device. Once the data has been transmitted, the secondary sends an acknowledgement specifies that the data has been received."
The Poll mode is used when the primary device wants to receive some data from the secondary device.
"When a primary device wants to receive the data, then it asks each device whether it has anything to send."
"Firstly, the primary asks (poll) the first secondary device, if it responds with the NACK (Negative Acknowledgement) means that it has nothing to send. Now, it approaches the second secondary device, it responds with the ACK means that it has the data to send. The secondary device can send more than one frame one after another or sometimes it may be required to send ACK before sending each one, depending on the type of the protocol being used."
It is a set of procedures that tells the sender how much data it can transmit before the data overwhelms the receiver.
"The receiving device has limited speed and limited memory to store the data. Therefore, the receiving device must be able to inform the sending device to stop the transmission temporarily before the limits are reached."
"It requires a buffer, a block of memory for storing the information until they are processed."
Two methods have been developed to control the flow of data:
"In the Stop-and-wait method, the sender waits for an acknowledgement after every frame it sends."
"When acknowledgement is received, then only next frame is sent. The process of alternately sending and waiting of a frame continues until the sender transmits the EOT (End of transmission) frame."
The Stop-and-wait method is simple as each frame is checked and acknowledged before the next frame is sent.
"Stop-and-wait technique is inefficient to use as each frame must travel across all the way to the receiver, and an acknowledgement travels all the way before the next frame is sent. Each frame sent and received uses the entire time needed to traverse the link."
The Sliding Window is a method of flow control in which a sender can transmit the several frames before getting an acknowledgement.
"In Sliding Window Control, multiple frames can be sent one after the another due to which capacity of the communication channel can be utilized efficiently."
Sliding Window refers to imaginary boxes at both the sender and receiver end.
"The window can hold the frames at either end, and it provides the upper limit on the number of frames that can be transmitted before the acknowledgement."
Frames can be acknowledged even when the window is not completely filled.
"The window has a specific size in which they are numbered as modulo-n means that they are numbered from 0 to n-1. For example, if n = 8, the frames are numbered from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,1........"
"The size of the window is represented as n-1. Therefore, maximum n-1 frames can be sent before acknowledgement."
"When the receiver sends the ACK, it includes the number of the next frame that it wants to receive. For example, to acknowledge the string of frames ending with frame number 4, the receiver will send the ACK containing the number 5. When the sender sees the ACK with the number 5, it got to know that the frames from 0 through 4 have been received."
"At the beginning of a transmission, the sender window contains n-1 frames, and when they are sent out, the left boundary moves inward shrinking the size of the window. For example, if the size of the window is w if three frames are sent out, then the number of frames left out in the sender window is w-3."
"Once the ACK has arrived, then the sender window expands to the number which will be equal to the number of frames acknowledged by ACK."
"For example, the size of the window is 7, and if frames 0 through 4 have been sent out and no acknowledgement has arrived, then the sender window contains only two frames, i.e., 5 and 6. Now, if ACK has arrived with a number 4 which means that 0 through 3 frames have arrived undamaged and the sender window is expanded to include the next four frames. Therefore, the sender window contains six frames (5,6,7,0,1,2)."
"At the beginning of transmission, the receiver window does not contain n frames, but it contains n-1 spaces for frames."
"When the new frame arrives, the size of the window shrinks."
"The receiver window does not represent the number of frames received, but it represents the number of frames that can be received before an ACK is sent. For example, the size of the window is w, if three frames are received then the number of spaces available in the window is (w-3)."
"Once the acknowledgement is sent, the receiver window expands by the number equal to the number of frames acknowledged."
"Suppose the size of the window is 7 means that the receiver window contains seven spaces for seven frames. If the one frame is received, then the receiver window shrinks and moving the boundary from 0 to 1. In this way, window shrinks one by one, so window now contains the six spaces. If frames from 0 through 4 have sent, then the window contains two spaces before an acknowledgement is sent."
Error Control is a technique of error detection and retransmission.
Stop-and-wait ARQ is a technique used to retransmit the data in case of damaged or lost frames.
This technique works on the principle that the sender will not transmit the next frame until it receives the acknowledgement of the last transmitted frame.
The sending device keeps a copy of the last transmitted frame until the acknowledgement is received. Keeping the copy allows the sender to retransmit the data if the frame is not received correctly.
Both the data frames and the ACK frames are numbered alternately 0 and 1 so that they can be identified individually. Suppose data 1 frame acknowledges the data 0 frame means that the data 0 frame has been arrived correctly and expects to receive data 1 frame.
"If an error occurs in the last transmitted frame, then the receiver sends the NAK frame which is not numbered. On receiving the NAK frame, sender retransmits the data."
"It works with the timer. If the acknowledgement is not received within the allotted time, then the sender assumes that the frame is lost during the transmission, so it will retransmit the frame."
"Damaged Frame: When the receiver receives a damaged frame, i.e., the frame contains an error, then it returns the NAK frame. For example, when the data 0 frame is sent, and then the receiver sends the ACK 1 frame means that the data 0 has arrived correctly, and transmits the data 1 frame. The sender transmits the next frame: data 1. It reaches undamaged, and the receiver returns ACK 0. The sender transmits the next frame: data 0. The receiver reports an error and returns the NAK frame. The sender retransmits the data 0 frame."
"Lost Frame: Sender is equipped with the timer and starts when the frame is transmitted. Sometimes the frame has not arrived at the receiving end so that it can be acknowledged neither positively nor negatively. The sender waits for acknowledgement until the timer goes off. If the timer goes off, it retransmits the last transmitted frame."
SlidingWindow ARQ is a technique used for continuous transmission error control.
"In this case, the sender keeps the copies of all the transmitted frames until they have been acknowledged. Suppose the frames from 0 through 4 have been transmitted, and the last acknowledgement was for frame 2, the sender has to keep the copies of frames 3 and 4 until they receive correctly."
"The receiver can send either NAK or ACK depending on the conditions. The NAK frame tells the sender that the data have been received damaged. Since the sliding window is a continuous transmission mechanism, both ACK and NAK must be numbered for the identification of a frame. The ACK frame consists of a number that represents the next frame which the receiver expects to receive. The NAK frame consists of a number that represents the damaged frame."
"The sliding window ARQ is equipped with the timer to handle the lost acknowledgements. Suppose then n-1 frames have been sent before receiving any acknowledgement. The sender waits for the acknowledgement, so it starts the timer and waits before sending any more. If the allotted time runs out, the sender retransmits one or all the frames depending upon the protocol used."
"Go-Back-n ARQ: In Go-Back-N ARQ protocol, if one frame is lost or damaged, then it retransmits all the frames after which it does not receive the positive ACK."
"Damaged Frame: When the frame is damaged, then the receiver sends a NAK frame."
"In the above figure, three frames have been transmitted before an error discovered in the third frame. In this case, ACK 2 has been returned telling that the frames 0,1 have been received successfully without any error. The receiver discovers the error in data 2 frame, so it returns the NAK 2 frame. The frame 3 is also discarded as it is transmitted after the damaged frame. Therefore, the sender retransmits the frames 2,3."
"Lost Data Frame: In Sliding window protocols, data frames are sent sequentially. If any of the frames is lost, then the next frame arrive at the receiver is out of sequence. The receiver checks the sequence number of each of the frame, discovers the frame that has been skipped, and returns the NAK for the missing frame. The sending device retransmits the frame indicated by NAK as well as the frames transmitted after the lost frame."
"Lost Acknowledgement: The sender can send as many frames as the windows allow before waiting for any acknowledgement. Once the limit of the window is reached, the sender has no more frames to send; it must wait for the acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement is lost, then the sender could wait forever. To avoid such situation, the sender is equipped with the timer that starts counting whenever the window capacity is reached. If the acknowledgement has not been received within the time limit, then the sender retransmits the frame since the last ACK."
"In this technique, only those frames are retransmitted for which negative acknowledgement (NAK) has been received."
The receiver storage buffer keeps all the damaged frames on hold until the frame in error is correctly received.
The receiver must have an appropriate logic for reinserting the frames in a correct order.
The sender must consist of a searching mechanism that selects only the requested frame for retransmission.
The Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model.
It handles the service requests from the transport layer and further forwards the service request to the data link layer.
The network layer translates the logical addresses into physical addresses
"It determines the route from the source to the destination and also manages the traffic problems such as switching, routing and controls the congestion of data packets."
The main role of the network layer is to move the packets from sending host to the receiving host.
"Routing: When a packet reaches the router's input link, the router will move the packets to the router's output link. For example, a packet from S1 to R1 must be forwarded to the next router on the path to S2."
Logical Addressing: The data link layer implements the physical addressing and network layer implements the logical addressing. Logical addressing is also used to distinguish between source and destination system. The network layer adds a header to the packet which includes the logical addresses of both the sender and the receiver.
Internetworking: This is the main role of the network layer that it provides the logical connection between different types of networks.
Fragmentation: The fragmentation is a process of breaking the packets into the smallest individual data units that travel through different networks.
"In Network layer, a router is used to forward the packets. Every router has a forwarding table. A router forwards a packet by examining a packet's header field and then using the header field value to index into the forwarding table. The value stored in the forwarding table corresponding to the header field value indicates the router's outgoing interface link to which the packet is to be forwarded."
"For example, the router with a header field value of 0111 arrives at a router, and then router indexes this header value into the forwarding table that determines the output link interface is 2. The router forwards the packet to the interface 2. The routing algorithm determines the values that are inserted in the forwarding table. The routing algorithm can be centralized or decentralized."
Guaranteed delivery: This layer provides the service which guarantees that the packet will arrive at its destination.
Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay: This service guarantees that the packet will be delivered within a specified host-to-host delay bound.
In-Order packets: This service ensures that the packet arrives at the destination in the order in which they are sent.
Guaranteed max jitter: This service ensures that the amount of time taken between two successive transmissions at the sender is equal to the time between their receipt at the destination.
"Security services: The network layer provides security by using a session key between the source and destination host. The network layer in the source host encrypts the payloads of datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then decrypt the payload. In such a way, the network layer maintains the data integrity and source authentication services."
Network Addressing is one of the major responsibilities of the network layer.
"A host is also known as end system that has one link to the network. The boundary between the host and link is known as an interface. Therefore, the host can have only one interface."
"A router is different from the host in that it has two or more links that connect to it. When a router forwards the datagram, then it forwards the packet to one of the links. The boundary between the router and link is known as an interface, and the router can have multiple interfaces, one for each of its links. Each interface is capable of sending and receiving the IP packets, so IP requires each interface to have an address."
"Each IP address is 32 bits long, and they are represented in the form of ""dot-decimal notation"" where each byte is written in the decimal form, and they are separated by the period. An IP address would look like 193.32.216.9 where 193 represents the decimal notation of first 8 bits of an address, 32 represents the decimal notation of second 8 bits of an address."
"In the above figure, a router has three interfaces labeled as 1, 2 & 3 and each router interface contains its own IP address."
"All the interfaces attached to the LAN 1 is having an IP address in the form of 223.1.1.xxx, and the interfaces attached to the LAN 2 and LAN 3 have an IP address in the form of 223.1.2.xxx and 223.1.3.xxx respectively."
Each IP address consists of two parts. The first part (first three bytes in IP address) specifies the network and second part (last byte of an IP address) specifies the host in the network.
An IP address is 32-bit long. An IP address is divided into sub-classes:
"In the above diagram, we observe that each class have a specific range of IP addresses. The class of IP address is used to determine the number of bits used in a class and number of networks and hosts available in the class."
"In Class A, an IP address is assigned to those networks that contain a large number of hosts."
"In Class A, the first bit in higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 0 and the remaining 7 bits determine the network ID. The 24 bits determine the host ID in any network."
The total number of networks in Class A = 27 = 128 network address
"The total number of hosts in Class A = 224 - 2 = 16,777,214 host address"
"In Class B, an IP address is assigned to those networks that range from small-sized to large-sized networks."
"In Class B, the higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 10, and the remaining14 bits determine the network ID. The other 16 bits determine the Host ID."
The total number of networks in Class B = 214 = 16384 network address
The total number of hosts in Class B = 216 - 2 = 65534 host address
"In Class C, an IP address is assigned to only small-sized networks."
"In Class C, the higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 110, and the remaining 21 bits determine the network ID. The 8 bits of the host ID determine the host in a network."
The total number of networks = 221 = 2097152 network address
The total number of hosts = 28 - 2 = 254 host address
"In Class D, an IP address is reserved for multicast addresses. It does not possess subnetting. The higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 1110, and the remaining bits determines the host ID in any network."
"In Class E, an IP address is used for the future use or for the research and development purposes. It does not possess any subnetting. The higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 1111, and the remaining bits determines the host ID in any network."
The Host ID is used to determine the host within any network. The Host ID is assigned based on the following rules:
The Host ID in which all the bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned as it is used to represent the network ID of the IP address.
The Host ID in which all the bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for the multicast address.
"If the hosts are located within the same local network, then they are assigned with the same network ID. The following are the rules for assigning Network ID:"
The network ID cannot start with 127 as 127 is used by Class A.
The Network ID in which all the bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned as it is used to specify a particular host on the local network.
The Network ID in which all the bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for the multicast address.
A Router is a process of selecting path along which the data can be transferred from source to the destination. Routing is performed by a special device known as a router.
A Router works at the network layer in the OSI model and internet layer in TCP/IP model
A router is a networking device that forwards the packet based on the information available in the packet header and forwarding table.
The routing algorithms are used for routing the packets. The routing algorithm is nothing but a software responsible for deciding the optimal path through which packet can be transmitted.
"The routing protocols use the metric to determine the best path for the packet delivery. The metric is the standard of measurement such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, current load on the path, etc. used by the routing algorithm to determine the optimal path to the destination."
The routing algorithm initializes and maintains the routing table for the process of path determination.
"Routing metrics and costs are used for determining the best route to the destination. The factors used by the protocols to determine the shortest path, these factors are known as a metric."
Metrics are the network variables used to determine the best route to the destination. For some protocols use the static metrics means that their value cannot be changed and for some other routing protocols use the dynamic metrics means that their value can be assigned by the system administrator.
"Hop count: Hop count is defined as a metric that specifies the number of passes through internetworking devices such as a router, a packet must travel in a route to move from source to the destination. If the routing protocol considers the hop as a primary metric value, then the path with the least hop count will be considered as the best path to move from source to the destination."
"Delay: It is a time taken by the router to process, queue and transmit a datagram to an interface. The protocols use this metric to determine the delay values for all the links along the path end-to-end. The path having the lowest delay value will be considered as the best path."
"Bandwidth: The capacity of the link is known as a bandwidth of the link. The bandwidth is measured in terms of bits per second. The link that has a higher transfer rate like gigabit is preferred over the link that has the lower capacity like 56 kb. The protocol will determine the bandwidth capacity for all the links along the path, and the overall higher bandwidth will be considered as the best route."
"Load: Load refers to the degree to which the network resource such as a router or network link is busy. A Load can be calculated in a variety of ways such as CPU utilization, packets processed per second. If the traffic increases, then the load value will also be increased. The load value changes with respect to the change in the traffic."
"Reliability: Reliability is a metric factor may be composed of a fixed value. It depends on the network links, and its value is measured dynamically. Some networks go down more often than others. After network failure, some network links repaired more easily than other network links. Any reliability factor can be considered for the assignment of reliability ratings, which are generally numeric values assigned by the system administrator."
It is a technique in which the administrator manually adds the routes in a routing table.
A Router can send the packets for the destination along the route defined by the administrator.
"In this technique, routing decisions are not made based on the condition or topology of the networks"
"No Overhead: It has ho overhead on the CPU usage of the router. Therefore, the cheaper router can be used to obtain static routing."
Security: It provides security as the system administrator is allowed only to have control over the routing to a particular network.
"For a large network, it becomes a very difficult task to add each route manually to the routing table."
The system administrator should have a good knowledge of a topology as he has to add each route manually.
"Default Routing is a technique in which a router is configured to send all the packets to the same hop device, and it doesn't matter whether it belongs to a particular network or not. A Packet is transmitted to the device for which it is configured in default routing."
Default Routing is used when networks deal with the single exit point.
It is also useful when the bulk of transmission networks have to transmit the data to the same hp device.
"When a specific route is mentioned in the routing table, the router will choose the specific route rather than the default route. The default route is chosen only when a specific route is not mentioned in the routing table."
It is a technique in which a router adds a new route in the routing table for each packet in response to the changes in the condition or topology of the network.
Dynamic protocols are used to discover the new routes to reach the destination.
"In Dynamic Routing, RIP and OSPF are the protocols used to discover the new routes."
"If any route goes down, then the automatic adjustment will be made to reach the destination."
All the routers must have the same dynamic routing protocol in order to exchange the routes.
"If the router discovers any change in the condition or topology, then router broadcast this information to all other routers."
It is more effective in selecting the best route in response to the changes in the condition or topology.
It is more expensive in terms of CPU and bandwidth usage.
It is less secure as compared to default and static routing.
It is used to associate an IP address with the MAC address.
"Each device on the network is recognized by the MAC address imprinted on the NIC. Therefore, we can say that devices need the MAC address for communication on a local area network. MAC address can be changed easily. For example, if the NIC on a particular machine fails, the MAC address changes but IP address does not change. ARP is used to find the MAC address of the node when an internet address is known."
"If the host wants to know the physical address of another host on its network, then it sends an ARP query packet that includes the IP address and broadcast it over the network. Every host on the network receives and processes the ARP packet, but only the intended recipient recognizes the IP address and sends back the physical address. The host holding the datagram adds the physical address to the cache memory and to the datagram header, then sends back to the sender."
"If a device wants to communicate with another device, the following steps are taken by the device:"
"The device will first look at its internet list, called the ARP cache to check whether an IP address contains a matching MAC address or not. It will check the ARP cache in command prompt by using a command arp-a."
"If ARP cache is empty, then device broadcast the message to the entire network asking each device for a matching MAC address."
The device that has the matching IP address will then respond back to the sender with its MAC address
"Once the MAC address is received by the device, then the communication can take place between two devices."
"If the device receives the MAC address, then the MAC address gets stored in the ARP cache. We can check the ARP cache in command prompt by using a command arp -a."
"In the above screenshot, we observe the association of IP address to the MAC address."
"Dynamic entry: It is an entry which is created automatically when the sender broadcast its message to the entire network. Dynamic entries are not permanent, and they are removed periodically."
Static entry: It is an entry where someone manually enters the IP to MAC address association by using the ARP command utility.
"If the host wants to know its IP address, then it broadcast the RARP query packet that contains its physical address to the entire network. A RARP server on the network recognizes the RARP packet and responds back with the host IP address."
The protocol which is used to obtain the IP address from a server is known as Reverse Address Resolution Protocol.
The message format of the RARP protocol is similar to the ARP protocol.
"Like ARP frame, RARP frame is sent from one machine to another encapsulated in the data portion of a frame."
The ICMP is a network layer protocol used by hosts and routers to send the notifications of IP datagram problems back to the sender.
ICMP uses echo test/reply to check whether the destination is reachable and responding.
"ICMP handles both control and error messages, but its main function is to report the error but not to correct them."
"An IP datagram contains the addresses of both source and destination, but it does not know the address of the previous router through which it has been passed. Due to this reason, ICMP can only send the messages to the source, but not to the immediate routers."
ICMP protocol communicates the error messages to the sender. ICMP messages cause the errors to be returned back to the user processes.
The second field specifies the reason for a particular message type.
Five types of errors are handled by the ICMP protocol:
"Destination unreachable: The message of ""Destination Unreachable"" is sent from receiver to the sender when destination cannot be reached, or packet is discarded when the destination is not reachable."
Source Quench: The purpose of the source quench message is congestion control. The message sent from the congested router to the source host to reduce the transmission rate. ICMP will take the IP of the discarded packet and then add the source quench message to the IP datagram to inform the source host to reduce its transmission rate. The source host will reduce the transmission rate so that the router will be free from congestion.
"Time Exceeded: Time Exceeded is also known as ""Time-To-Live"". It is a parameter that defines how long a packet should live before it would be discarded."
There are two ways when Time Exceeded message can be generated:
"Sometimes packet discarded due to some bad routing implementation, and this causes the looping issue and network congestion. Due to the looping issue, the value of TTL keeps on decrementing, and when it reaches zero, the router discards the datagram. However, when the datagram is discarded by the router, the time exceeded message will be sent by the router to the source host."
"When destination host does not receive all the fragments in a certain time limit, then the received fragments are also discarded, and the destination host sends time Exceeded message to the source host."
"Parameter problems: When a router or host discovers any missing value in the IP datagram, the router discards the datagram, and the ""parameter problem"" message is sent back to the source host."
"Redirection: Redirection message is generated when host consists of a small routing table. When the host consists of a limited number of entries due to which it sends the datagram to a wrong router. The router that receives a datagram will forward a datagram to a correct router and also sends the ""Redirection message"" to the host to update its routing table."
"The IP protocol supports two types of communication:

Unicasting: It is a communication between one sender and one receiver. Therefore, we can say that it is one-to-one communication.
Multicasting: Sometimes the sender wants to send the same message to a large number of receivers simultaneously. This process is known as multicasting which has one-to-many communication."
"Unicasting: It is a communication between one sender and one receiver. Therefore, we can say that it is one-to-one communication."
Multicasting: Sometimes the sender wants to send the same message to a large number of receivers simultaneously. This process is known as multicasting which has one-to-many communication.
The IGMP protocol is used by the hosts and router to support multicasting.
The IGMP protocol is used by the hosts and router to identify the hosts in a LAN that are the members of a group.
"IGMP is a part of the IP layer, and IGMP has a fixed-size message."
"Type: It determines the type of IGMP message. There are three types of IGMP message: Membership Query, Membership Report and Leave Report."
Maximum Response Time: This field is used only by the Membership Query message. It determines the maximum time the host can send the Membership Report message in response to the Membership Query message.
Checksum: It determines the entire payload of the IP datagram in which IGMP message is encapsulated.
Group Address: The behavior of this field depends on the type of the message sent.
"For Membership Query, the group address is set to zero for General Query and set to multicast group address for a specific query."
"For Membership Report, the group address is set to the multicast group address."
"For Leave Group, it is set to the multicast group address."
"Membership Query message

This message is sent by a router to all hosts on a local area network to determine the set of all the multicast groups that have been joined by the host. 
It also determines whether a specific multicast group has been joined by the hosts on a attached interface.
The group address in the query is zero since the router expects one response from a host for every group that contains one or more members on that host."
This message is sent by a router to all hosts on a local area network to determine the set of all the multicast groups that have been joined by the host.
It also determines whether a specific multicast group has been joined by the hosts on a attached interface.
The group address in the query is zero since the router expects one response from a host for every group that contains one or more members on that host.
"Membership Report message

The host responds to the membership query message with a membership report message.
Membership report messages can also be generated by the host when a host wants to join the multicast group without waiting for a membership query message from the router.
Membership report messages are received by a router as well as all the hosts on an attached interface.
Each membership report message includes the multicast address of a single group that the host wants to join.
IGMP protocol does not care which host has joined the group or how many hosts are present in a single group. It only cares whether one or more attached hosts belong to a single multicast group.
The membership Query message sent by a router also includes a ""Maximum Response time"". After receiving a membership query message and before sending the membership report message, the host waits for the random amount of time from 0 to the maximum response time. If a host observes that some other attached host has sent the ""Maximum Report message"", then it discards its ""Maximum Report message"" as it knows that the attached router already knows that one or more hosts have joined a single multicast group. This process is known as feedback suppression. It provides the performance optimization, thus avoiding the unnecessary transmission of a ""Membership Report message""."

"Leave Report
When the host does not send the ""Membership Report message"", it means that the host has left the group. The host knows that there are no members in the group, so even when it receives the next query, it would not report the group."
"In order to transfer the packets from source to the destination, the network layer must determine the best route through which packets can be transmitted."
"Whether the network layer provides datagram service or virtual circuit service, the main job of the network layer is to provide the best route. The routing protocol provides this job."
"The routing protocol is a routing algorithm that provides the best path from the source to the destination. The best path is the path that has the ""least-cost path"" from source to the destination."
Routing is the process of forwarding the packets from source to the destination but the best route to send the packets is determined by the routing algorithm.
An adaptive routing algorithm is also known as dynamic routing algorithm.
This algorithm makes the routing decisions based on the topology and network traffic.
"The main parameters related to this algorithm are hop count, distance and estimated transit time."
An adaptive routing algorithm can be classified into three parts:
"Centralized algorithm: It is also known as global routing algorithm as it computes the least-cost path between source and destination by using complete and global knowledge about the network. This algorithm takes the connectivity between the nodes and link cost as input, and this information is obtained before actually performing any calculation. Link state algorithm is referred to as a centralized algorithm since it is aware of the cost of each link in the network."
Isolation algorithm: It is an algorithm that obtains the routing information by using local information rather than gathering information from other nodes.
"Distributed algorithm: It is also known as decentralized algorithm as it computes the least-cost path between source and destination in an iterative and distributed manner. In the decentralized algorithm, no node has the knowledge about the cost of all the network links. In the beginning, a node contains the information only about its own directly attached links and through an iterative process of calculation computes the least-cost path to the destination. A Distance vector algorithm is a decentralized algorithm as it never knows the complete path from source to the destination, instead it knows the direction through which the packet is to be forwarded along with the least cost path."
Non Adaptive routing algorithm is also known as a static routing algorithm.
"When booting up the network, the routing information stores to the routers."
Non Adaptive routing algorithms do not take the routing decision based on the network topology or network traffic.
"Flooding: In case of flooding, every incoming packet is sent to all the outgoing links except the one from it has been reached. The disadvantage of flooding is that node may contain several copies of a particular packet."
"Random walks: In case of random walks, a packet sent by the node to one of its neighbors randomly. An advantage of using random walks is that it uses the alternative routes very efficiently."
"The Distance vector algorithm is iterative, asynchronous and distributed.

Distributed: It is distributed in that each node receives information from one or more of its directly attached neighbors, performs calculation and then distributes the result back to its neighbors. 
Iterative: It is iterative in that its process continues until no more information is available to be exchanged between neighbors.
Asynchronous: It does not require that all of its nodes operate in the lock step with each other."
"Distributed: It is distributed in that each node receives information from one or more of its directly attached neighbors, performs calculation and then distributes the result back to its neighbors."
Iterative: It is iterative in that its process continues until no more information is available to be exchanged between neighbors.
Asynchronous: It does not require that all of its nodes operate in the lock step with each other.
Knowledge about the whole network: Each router shares its knowledge through the entire network. The Router sends its collected knowledge about the network to its neighbors.
Routing only to neighbors: The router sends its knowledge about the network to only those routers which have direct links. The router sends whatever it has about the network through the ports. The information is received by the router and uses the information to update its own routing table.
"Information sharing at regular intervals: Within 30 seconds, the router sends the information to the neighboring routers."
"Let dx(y) be the cost of the least-cost path from node x to node y. The least costs are related by Bellman-Ford equation,"
"Where the minv is the equation taken for all x neighbors. After traveling from x to v, if we consider the least-cost path from v to y, the path cost will be c(x,v)+dv(y). The least cost from x to y is the minimum of c(x,v)+dv(y) taken over all neighbors."
"With the Distance Vector Routing algorithm, the node x contains the following routing information:"
"For each neighbor v, the cost c(x,v) is the path cost from x to directly attached neighbor, v."
"The distance vector x, i.e., Dx = [ Dx(y) : y in N ], containing its cost to all destinations, y, in N."
"The distance vector of each of its neighbors, i.e., Dv = [ Dv(y) : y in N ] for each neighbor v of x."
"Distance vector routing is an asynchronous algorithm in which node x sends the copy of its distance vector to all its neighbors. When node x receives the new distance vector from one of its neighboring vector, v, it saves the distance vector of v and uses the Bellman-Ford equation to update its own distance vector. The equation is given below:"
The node x has updated its own distance vector table by using the above equation and sends its updated table to all its neighbors so that they can update their own distance vectors.
"In the above figure, each cloud represents the network, and the number inside the cloud represents the network ID."
"All the LANs are connected by routers, and they are represented in boxes labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F."
"Distance vector routing algorithm simplifies the routing process by assuming the cost of every link is one unit. Therefore, the efficiency of transmission can be measured by the number of links to reach the destination."
"In Distance vector routing, the cost is based on hop count."
"In the above figure, we observe that the router sends the knowledge to the immediate neighbors. The neighbors add this knowledge to their own knowledge and sends the updated table to their own neighbors. In this way, routers get its own information plus the new information about the neighbors."
"Initially, the routing table is created for each router that contains atleast three types of information such as Network ID, the cost and the next hop."
NET ID: The Network ID defines the final destination of the packet.
Cost: The cost is the number of hops that packet must take to get there.
Next hop: It is the router to which the packet must be delivered.
"In the above figure, the original routing tables are shown of all the routers. In a routing table, the first column represents the network ID, the second column represents the cost of the link, and the third column is empty."
"When A receives a routing table from B, then it uses its information to update the table."
The routing table of B shows how the packets can move to the networks 1 and 4.
"The B is a neighbor to the A router, the packets from A to B can reach in one hop. So, 1 is added to all the costs given in the B's table and the sum will be the cost to reach a particular network."
"After adjustment, A then combines this table with its own table to create a combined table."
"The combined table may contain some duplicate data. In the above figure, the combined table of router A contains the duplicate data, so it keeps only those data which has the lowest cost. For example, A can send the data to network 1 in two ways. The first, which uses no next router, so it costs one hop. The second requires two hops (A to B, then B to Network 1). The first option has the lowest cost, therefore it is kept and the second one is dropped."
"The process of creating the routing table continues for all routers. Every router receives the information from the neighbors, and update the routing table."
Final routing tables of all the routers are given below:
Link state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its neighborhood with every other router in the internetwork.
The three keys to understand the Link State Routing algorithm:
"Knowledge about the neighborhood: Instead of sending its routing table, a router sends the information about its neighborhood only. A router broadcast its identities and cost of the directly attached links to other routers."
"Flooding: Each router sends the information to every other router on the internetwork except its neighbors. This process is known as Flooding. Every router that receives the packet sends the copies to all its neighbors. Finally, each and every router receives a copy of the same information."
Information sharing: A router sends the information to every other router only when the change occurs in the information.
Initial state: Each node knows the cost of its neighbors.
Each node uses Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph to calculate the optimal routes to all nodes.
The Link state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra's algorithm which is used to find the shortest path from one node to every other node in the network.
"The Dijkstra's algorithm is an iterative, and it has the property that after kth iteration of the algorithm, the least cost paths are well known for k destination nodes."
"c( i , j): Link cost from node i to node j. If i and j nodes are not directly linked, then c(i , j) = ∞."
D(v): It defines the cost of the path from source code to destination v that has the least cost currently.
P(v): It defines the previous node (neighbor of v) along with current least cost path from source to v.
N: It is the total number of nodes available in the network.
"In the above algorithm, an initialization step is followed by the loop. The number of times the loop is executed is equal to the total number of nodes available in the network."
"The first step is an initialization step. The currently known least cost path from A to its directly attached neighbors, B, C, D are 2,5,1 respectively. The cost from A to B is set to 2, from A to D is set to 1 and from A to C is set to 5. The cost from A to E and F are set to infinity as they are not directly linked to A."
"In the above table, we observe that vertex D contains the least cost path in step 1. Therefore, it is added in N. Now, we need to determine a least-cost path through D vertex."
"In the above table, we observe that both E and B have the least cost path in step 2. Let's consider the E vertex. Now, we determine the least cost path of remaining vertices through E."
"In the above table, we observe that B vertex has the least cost path in step 3. Therefore, it is added in N. Now, we determine the least cost path of remaining vertices through B."
"In the above table, we observe that C vertex has the least cost path in step 4. Therefore, it is added in N. Now, we determine the least cost path of remaining vertices through C."
"Heavy traffic is created in Line state routing due to Flooding. Flooding can cause an infinite looping, this problem can be solved by using Time-to-leave field"
The transport layer is a 4th layer from the top.
The main role of the transport layer is to provide the communication services directly to the application processes running on different hosts.
"The transport layer provides a logical communication between application processes running on different hosts. Although the application processes on different hosts are not physically connected, application processes use the logical communication provided by the transport layer to send the messages to each other."
The transport layer protocols are implemented in the end systems but not in the network routers.
"A computer network provides more than one protocol to the network applications. For example, TCP and UDP are two transport layer protocols that provide a different set of services to the network layer."
"All transport layer protocols provide multiplexing/demultiplexing service. It also provides other services such as reliable data transfer, bandwidth guarantees, and delay guarantees."
"Each of the applications in the application layer has the ability to send a message by using TCP or UDP. The application communicates by using either of these two protocols. Both TCP and UDP will then communicate with the internet protocol in the internet layer. The applications can read and write to the transport layer. Therefore, we can say that communication is a two-way process."
The services provided by the transport layer are similar to those of the data link layer. The data link layer provides the services within a single network while the transport layer provides the services across an internetwork made up of many networks. The data link layer controls the physical layer while the transport layer controls all the lower layers.
The services provided by the transport layer protocols can be divided into five categories:
"The transport layer transmits the entire message to the destination. Therefore, it ensures the end-to-end delivery of an entire message from a source to the destination."
The transport layer provides reliability services by retransmitting the lost and damaged packets.
"The primary role of reliability is Error Control. In reality, no transmission will be 100 percent error-free delivery. Therefore, transport layer protocols are designed to provide error-free transmission."
"The data link layer also provides the error handling mechanism, but it ensures only node-to-node error-free delivery. However, node-to-node reliability does not ensure the end-to-end reliability."
"The data link layer checks for the error between each network. If an error is introduced inside one of the routers, then this error will not be caught by the data link layer. It only detects those errors that have been introduced between the beginning and end of the link. Therefore, the transport layer performs the checking for the errors end-to-end to ensure that the packet has arrived correctly."
The second aspect of the reliability is sequence control which is implemented at the transport layer.
"On the sending end, the transport layer is responsible for ensuring that the packets received from the upper layers can be used by the lower layers. On the receiving end, it ensures that the various segments of a transmission can be correctly reassembled."
"Loss Control is a third aspect of reliability. The transport layer ensures that all the fragments of a transmission arrive at the destination, not some of them. On the sending end, all the fragments of transmission are given sequence numbers by a transport layer. These sequence numbers allow the receiver?s transport layer to identify the missing segment."
"Duplication Control is the fourth aspect of reliability. The transport layer guarantees that no duplicate data arrive at the destination. Sequence numbers are used to identify the lost packets; similarly, it allows the receiver to identify and discard duplicate segments."
"Flow control is used to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver. If the receiver is overloaded with too much data, then the receiver discards the packets and asking for the retransmission of packets. This increases network congestion and thus, reducing the system performance. The transport layer is responsible for flow control. It uses the sliding window protocol that makes the data transmission more efficient as well as it controls the flow of data so that the receiver does not become overwhelmed. Sliding window protocol is byte oriented rather than frame oriented."
The transport layer uses the multiplexing to improve transmission efficiency.
"Upward multiplexing: Upward multiplexing means multiple transport layer connections use the same network connection. To make more cost-effective, the transport layer sends several transmissions bound for the same destination along the same path; this is achieved through upward multiplexing."
Downward multiplexing: Downward multiplexing means one transport layer connection uses the multiple network connections. Downward multiplexing allows the transport layer to split a connection among several paths to improve the throughput. This type of multiplexing is used when networks have a low or slow capacity.
"According to the layered model, the transport layer interacts with the functions of the session layer. Many protocols combine session, presentation, and application layer protocols into a single layer known as the application layer. In these cases, delivery to the session layer means the delivery to the application layer. Data generated by an application on one machine must be transmitted to the correct application on another machine. In this case, addressing is provided by the transport layer."
The transport layer provides the user address which is specified as a station or port. The port variable represents a particular TS user of a specified station known as a Transport Service access point (TSAP). Each station has only one transport entity.
The transport layer protocols need to know which upper-layer protocols are communicating.
The transport layer is represented by two protocols: TCP and UDP.
The IP protocol in the network layer delivers a datagram from a source host to the destination host.
"Nowadays, the operating system supports multiuser and multiprocessing environments, an executing program is called a process. When a host sends a message to other host means that source process is sending a process to a destination process. The transport layer protocols define some connections to individual ports known as protocol ports."
"An IP protocol is a host-to-host protocol used to deliver a packet from source host to the destination host while transport layer protocols are port-to-port protocols that work on the top of the IP protocols to deliver the packet from the originating port to the IP services, and from IP services to the destination port."
"Each port is defined by a positive integer address, and it is of 16 bits."
UDP is a simple protocol and it provides nonsequenced transport functionality.
This type of protocol is used when reliability and security are less important than speed and size.
"UDP is an end-to-end transport level protocol that adds transport-level addresses, checksum error control, and length information to the data from the upper layer."
The packet produced by the UDP protocol is known as a user datagram.
The user datagram has a 16-byte header which is shown below:
Source port address: It defines the address of the application process that has delivered a message. The source port address is of 16 bits address.
Destination port address: It defines the address of the application process that will receive the message. The destination port address is of a 16-bit address.
Total length: It defines the total length of the user datagram in bytes. It is a 16-bit field.
Checksum: The checksum is a 16-bit field which is used in error detection.
UDP provides basic functions needed for the end-to-end delivery of a transmission.
It does not provide any sequencing or reordering functions and does not specify the damaged packet when reporting an error.
"UDP can discover that an error has occurred, but it does not specify which packet has been lost as it does not contain an ID or sequencing number of a particular data segment."
"It is a connection-oriented protocol means the connection established between both the ends of the transmission. For creating the connection, TCP generates a virtual circuit between sender and receiver for the duration of a transmission."
Stream data transfer: TCP protocol transfers the data in the form of contiguous stream of bytes. TCP group the bytes in the form of TCP segments and then passed it to the IP layer for transmission to the destination. TCP itself segments the data and forward to the IP.
"Reliability: TCP assigns a sequence number to each byte transmitted and expects a positive acknowledgement from the receiving TCP. If ACK is not received within a timeout interval, then the data is retransmitted to the destination.
The receiving TCP uses the sequence number to reassemble the segments if they arrive out of order or to eliminate the duplicate segments."
Flow Control: When receiving TCP sends an acknowledgement back to the sender indicating the number the bytes it can receive without overflowing its internal buffer. The number of bytes is sent in ACK in the form of the highest sequence number that it can receive without any problem. This mechanism is also referred to as a window mechanism.
"Multiplexing: Multiplexing is a process of accepting the data from different applications and forwarding to the different applications on different computers. At the receiving end, the data is forwarded to the correct application. This process is known as demultiplexing. TCP transmits the packet to the correct application by using the logical channels known as ports."
"Logical Connections: The combination of sockets, sequence numbers, and window sizes, is called a logical connection. Each connection is identified by the pair of sockets used by sending and receiving processes."
"Full Duplex: TCP provides Full Duplex service, i.e., the data flow in both the directions at the same time. To achieve Full Duplex service, each TCP should have sending and receiving buffers so that the segments can flow in both the directions. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Suppose the process A wants to send and receive the data from process B. The following steps occur:

Establish a connection between two TCPs.
Data is exchanged in both the directions.
The Connection is terminated."
Source port address: It is used to define the address of the application program in a source computer. It is a 16-bit field.
Destination port address: It is used to define the address of the application program in a destination computer. It is a 16-bit field.
Sequence number: A stream of data is divided into two or more TCP segments. The 32-bit sequence number field represents the position of the data in an original data stream.
"Acknowledgement number: A 32-field acknowledgement number acknowledge the data from other communicating devices. If ACK field is set to 1, then it specifies the sequence number that the receiver is expecting to receive."
"Header Length (HLEN): It specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words. The minimum size of the header is 5 words, and the maximum size of the header is 15 words. Therefore, the maximum size of the TCP header is 60 bytes, and the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes."
Reserved: It is a six-bit field which is reserved for future use.
Control bits: Each bit of a control field functions individually and independently. A control bit defines the use of a segment or serves as a validity check for other fields.
URG: The URG field indicates that the data in a segment is urgent.
"ACK: When ACK field is set, then it validates the acknowledgement number."
"PSH: The PSH field is used to inform the sender that higher throughput is needed so if possible, data must be pushed with higher throughput."
RST: The reset bit is used to reset the TCP connection when there is any confusion occurs in the sequence numbers.
"SYN: The SYN field is used to synchronize the sequence numbers in three types of segments: connection request, connection confirmation ( with the ACK bit set ), and confirmation acknowledgement."
"FIN: The FIN field is used to inform the receiving TCP module that the sender has finished sending data. It is used in connection termination in three types of segments: termination request, termination confirmation, and acknowledgement of termination confirmation.

Window Size: The window is a 16-bit field that defines the size of the window.
Checksum: The checksum is a 16-bit field used in error detection.
Urgent pointer: If URG flag is set to 1, then this 16-bit field is an offset from the sequence number indicating that it is a last urgent data byte.
Options and padding: It defines the optional fields that convey the additional information to the receiver."

The application layer in the OSI model is the closest layer to the end user which means that the application layer and end user can interact directly with the software application. The application layer programs are based on client and servers.
Identifying communication partners: The application layer identifies the availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit.
Determining resource availability: The application layer determines whether sufficient network resources are available for the requested communication.
Synchronizing communication: All the communications occur between the applications requires cooperation which is managed by an application layer.
"Network Virtual terminal: An application layer allows a user to log on to a remote host. To do so, the application creates a software emulation of a terminal at the remote host. The user's computer talks to the software terminal, which in turn, talks to the host. The remote host thinks that it is communicating with one of its own terminals, so it allows the user to log on."
"File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM): An application allows a user to access files in a remote computer, to retrieve files from a computer and to manage files in a remote computer. FTAM defines a hierarchical virtual file in terms of file structure, file attributes and the kind of operations performed on the files and their attributes."
"Addressing: To obtain communication between client and server, there is a need for addressing. When a client made a request to the server, the request contains the server address and its own address. The server response to the client request, the request contains the destination address, i.e., client address. To achieve this kind of addressing, DNS is used."
Mail Services: An application layer provides Email forwarding and storage.
Directory Services: An application contains a distributed database that provides access for global information about various objects and services.
"Application architecture is different from the network architecture. The network architecture is fixed and provides a set of services to applications. The application architecture, on the other hand, is designed by the application developer and defines how the application should be structured over the various end systems."
"Client-server architecture: An application program running on the local machine sends a request to another application program is known as a client, and a program that serves a request is known as a server. For example, when a web server receives a request from the client host, it responds to the request to the client host."
"In Client-server architecture, clients do not directly communicate with each other. For example, in a web application, two browsers do not directly communicate with each other."
"A server is fixed, well-known address known as IP address because the server is always on while the client can always contact the server by sending a packet to the sender's IP address."
"It is a single-server based architecture which is incapable of holding all the requests from the clients. For example, a social networking site can become overwhelmed when there is only one server exists."
"P2P (peer-to-peer) architecture: It has no dedicated server in a data center. The peers are the computers which are not owned by the service provider. Most of the peers reside in the homes, offices, schools, and universities. The peers communicate with each other without passing the information through a dedicated server, this architecture is known as peer-to-peer architecture. The applications based on P2P architecture includes file sharing and internet telephony."
"Self scalability: In a file sharing system, although each peer generates a workload by requesting the files, each peer also adds a service capacity by distributing the files to the peer."
Cost-effective: It is cost-effective as it does not require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth.
A network application consists of a pair of processes that send the messages to each other over a network.
"In P2P file-sharing system, a file is transferred from a process in one peer to a process in another peer. We label one of the two processes as the client and another process as the server."
"With P2P file sharing, the peer which is downloading the file is known as a client, and the peer which is uploading the file is known as a server. However, we have observed in some applications such as P2P file sharing; a process can be both as a client and server. Therefore, we can say that a process can both download and upload the files."
A client and server networking model is a model in which computers such as servers provide the network services to the other computers such as clients to perform a user based tasks. This model is known as client-server networking model.
The application programs using the client-server model should follow the given below strategies:
"An application program is known as a client program, running on the local machine that requests for a service from an application program known as a server program, running on the remote machine."
A client program runs only when it requests for a service from the server while the server program runs all time as it does not know when its service is required.
"A server provides a service for many clients not just for a single client. Therefore, we can say that client-server follows the many-to-one relationship. Many clients can use the service of one server."
"Services are required frequently, and many users have a specific client-server application program. For example, the client-server application program allows the user to access the files, send e-mail, and so on. If the services are more customized, then we should have one generic application program that allows the user to access the services available on the remote computer."
A client is a program that runs on the local machine requesting service from the server. A client program is a finite program means that the service started by the user and terminates when the service is completed.
"A server is a program that runs on the remote machine providing services to the clients. When the client requests for a service, then the server opens the door for the incoming requests, but it never initiates the service."
"A server program is an infinite program means that when it starts, it runs infinitely unless the problem arises. The server waits for the incoming requests from the clients. When the request arrives at the server, then it responds to the request."
"Centralized: Centralized back-up is possible in client-server networks, i.e., all the data is stored in a server."
Security: These networks are more secure as all the shared resources are centrally administered.
Performance: The use of the dedicated server increases the speed of sharing resources. This increases the performance of the overall system.
"Scalability: We can increase the number of clients and servers separately, i.e., the new element can be added, or we can add a new node in a network at any time."
Traffic Congestion is a big problem in Client/Server networks. When a large number of clients send requests to the same server may cause the problem of Traffic congestion.
"It does not have a robustness of a network, i.e., when the server is down, then the client requests cannot be met."
"A client/server network is very decisive. Sometimes, regular computer hardware does not serve a certain number of clients. In such situations, specific hardware is required at the server side to complete the work."
"Sometimes the resources exist in the server but may not exist in the client. For example, If the application is web, then we cannot take the print out directly on printers without taking out the print view window on the web."
"An application layer protocol defines how the application processes running on different systems, pass the messages to each other."
DNS is a directory service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its numerical address.
"Each node in a tree has a domain name, and a full domain name is a sequence of symbols specified by dots."
DNS is a service that translates the domain name into IP addresses. This allows the users of networks to utilize user-friendly names when looking for other hosts instead of remembering the IP addresses.
"For example, suppose the FTP site at EduSoft had an IP address of 132.147.165.50, most people would reach this site by specifying ftp.EduSoft.com. Therefore, the domain name is more reliable than IP address."
"DNS is a TCP/IP protocol used on different platforms. The domain name space is divided into three different sections: generic domains, country domains, and inverse domain."
It defines the registered hosts according to their generic behavior.
"Each node in a tree defines the domain name, which is an index to the DNS database."
"It uses three-character labels, and these labels describe the organization type."
"The format of country domain is same as a generic domain, but it uses two-character country abbreviations (e.g., us for the United States) in place of three character organizational abbreviations."
"The inverse domain is used for mapping an address to a name. When the server has received a request from the client, and the server contains the files of only authorized clients. To determine whether the client is on the authorized list or not, it sends a query to the DNS server and ask for mapping an address to the name."
DNS is a client/server network communication protocol. DNS clients send requests to the. server while DNS servers send responses to the client.
Client requests contain a name which is converted into an IP address known as a forward DNS lookups while requests containing an IP address which is converted into a name known as reverse DNS lookups.
DNS implements a distributed database to store the name of all the hosts available on the internet.
"If a client like a web browser sends a request containing a hostname, then a piece of software such as DNS resolver sends a request to the DNS server to obtain the IP address of a hostname. If DNS server does not contain the IP address associated with a hostname, then it forwards the request to another DNS server. If IP address has arrived at the resolver, which in turn completes the request over the internet protocol."
FTP is a standard internet protocol provided by TCP/IP used for transmitting the files from one host to another.
It is mainly used for transferring the web page files from their creator to the computer that acts as a server for other computers on the internet.
It is also used for downloading the files to computer from other servers.
It is used to encourage the use of remote computers.
"Although transferring files from one system to another is very simple and straightforward, but sometimes it can cause problems. For example, two systems may have different file conventions. Two systems may have different ways to represent text and data. Two systems may have different directory structures. FTP protocol overcomes these problems by establishing two connections between hosts. One connection is used for data transfer, and another connection is used for the control connection."
"The above figure shows the basic model of the FTP. The FTP client has three components: the user interface, control process, and data transfer process. The server has two components: the server control process and the server data transfer process."
"Control Connection: The control connection uses very simple rules for communication. Through control connection, we can transfer a line of command or line of response at a time. The control connection is made between the control processes. The control connection remains connected during the entire interactive FTP session."
Data Connection: The Data Connection uses very complex rules as data types may vary. The data connection is made between data transfer processes. The data connection opens when a command comes for transferring the files and closes when the file is transferred.
FTP client is a program that implements a file transfer protocol which allows you to transfer files between two hosts on the internet.
It allows a user to connect to a remote host and upload or download the files.
"It has a set of commands that we can use to connect to a host, transfer the files between you and your host and close the connection."
The FTP program is also available as a built-in component in a Web browser. This GUI based FTP client makes the file transfer very easy and also does not require to remember the FTP commands.
Speed: One of the biggest advantages of FTP is speed. The FTP is one of the fastest way to transfer the files from one computer to another computer.
Efficient: It is more efficient as we do not need to complete all the operations to get the entire file.
"Security: To access the FTP server, we need to login with the username and password. Therefore, we can say that FTP is more secure."
"Back & forth movement: FTP allows us to transfer the files back and forth. Suppose you are a manager of the company, you send some information to all the employees, and they all send information back on the same server."
"The standard requirement of the industry is that all the FTP transmissions should be encrypted. However, not all the FTP providers are equal and not all the providers offer encryption. So, we will have to look out for the FTP providers that provides encryption."
"FTP serves two operations, i.e., to send and receive large files on a network. However, the size limit of the file is 2GB that can be sent. It also doesn't allow you to run simultaneous transfers to multiple receivers."
"Passwords and file contents are sent in clear text that allows unwanted eavesdropping. So, it is quite possible that attackers can carry out the brute force attack by trying to guess the FTP password."
"The main task of the internet is to provide services to users. For example, users want to run different application programs at the remote site and transfers a result to the local site. This requires a client-server program such as FTP, SMTP. But this would not allow us to create a specific program for each demand."
"The better solution is to provide a general client-server program that lets the user access any application program on a remote computer. Therefore, a program that allows a user to log on to a remote computer. A popular client-server program Telnet is used to meet such demands. Telnet is an abbreviation for Terminal Network."
Telnet provides a connection to the remote computer in such a way that a local terminal appears to be at the remote side.
"When a user logs into a local computer, then it is known as local login."
"When the workstation running terminal emulator, the keystrokes entered by the user are accepted by the terminal driver. The terminal driver then passes these characters to the operating system which in turn, invokes the desired application program."
"However, the operating system has special meaning to special characters. For example, in UNIX some combination of characters have special meanings such as control character with ""z"" means suspend. Such situations do not create any problem as the terminal driver knows the meaning of such characters. But, it can cause the problems in remote login."
"When the user wants to access an application program on a remote computer, then the user must perform remote login."
"The user sends the keystrokes to the terminal driver, the characters are then sent to the TELNET client. The TELNET client which in turn, transforms the characters to a universal character set known as network virtual terminal characters and delivers them to the local TCP/IP stack"
"The commands in NVT forms are transmitted to the TCP/IP at the remote machine. Here, the characters are delivered to the operating system and then pass to the TELNET server. The TELNET server transforms the characters which can be understandable by a remote computer. However, the characters cannot be directly passed to the operating system as a remote operating system does not receive the characters from the TELNET server. Therefore it requires some piece of software that can accept the characters from the TELNET server. The operating system then passes these characters to the appropriate application program."
The network virtual terminal is an interface that defines how data and commands are sent across the network.
"In today's world, systems are heterogeneous. For example, the operating system accepts a special combination of characters such as end-of-file token running a DOS operating system ctrl+z while the token running a UNIX operating system is ctrl+d."
TELNET solves this issue by defining a universal interface known as network virtual interface.
The TELNET client translates the characters that come from the local terminal into NVT form and then delivers them to the network. The Telnet server then translates the data from NVT form into a form which can be understandable by a remote computer.
SMTP is a set of communication guidelines that allow software to transmit an electronic mail over the internet is called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
It is a program used for sending messages to other computer users based on e-mail addresses.
"It provides a mail exchange between users on the same or different computers, and it also supports:

It can send a single message to one or more recipients.
Sending message can include text, voice, video or graphics.
It can also send the messages on networks outside the internet."
It can send a single message to one or more recipients.
It can also send the messages on networks outside the internet.
"The main purpose of SMTP is used to set up communication rules between servers. The servers have a way of identifying themselves and announcing what kind of communication they are trying to perform. They also have a way of handling the errors such as incorrect email address. For example, if the recipient address is wrong, then receiving server reply with an error message of some kind."
"First, we will break the SMTP client and SMTP server into two components such as user agent (UA) and mail transfer agent (MTA). The user agent (UA) prepares the message, creates the envelope and then puts the message in the envelope. The mail transfer agent (MTA) transfers this mail across the internet."
"SMTP allows a more complex system by adding a relaying system. Instead of just having one MTA at sending side and one at receiving side, more MTAs can be added, acting either as a client or server to relay the email."
"The relaying system without TCP/IP protocol can also be used to send the emails to users, and this is achieved by the use of the mail gateway. The mail gateway is a relay MTA that can be used to receive an email."
"Composition of Mail: A user sends an e-mail by composing an electronic mail message using a Mail User Agent (MUA). Mail User Agent is a program which is used to send and receive mail. The message contains two parts: body and header. The body is the main part of the message while the header includes information such as the sender and recipient address. The header also includes descriptive information such as the subject of the message. In this case, the message body is like a letter and header is like an envelope that contains the recipient's address."
"Submission of Mail: After composing an email, the mail client then submits the completed e-mail to the SMTP server by using SMTP on TCP port 25."
"Delivery of Mail: E-mail addresses contain two parts: username of the recipient and domain name. For example, [email protected], where ""vivek"" is the username of the recipient and ""gmail.com"" is the domain name.
If the domain name of the recipient's email address is different from the sender's domain name, then MSA will send the mail to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). To relay the email, the MTA will find the target domain. It checks the MX record from Domain Name System to obtain the target domain. The MX record contains the domain name and IP address of the recipient's domain. Once the record is located, MTA connects to the exchange server to relay the message."
"Receipt and Processing of Mail: Once the incoming message is received, the exchange server delivers it to the incoming server (Mail Delivery Agent) which stores the e-mail where it waits for the user to retrieve it."
Access and Retrieval of Mail: The stored email in MDA can be retrieved by using MUA (Mail User Agent). MUA can be accessed by using login and password.
SNMP is a framework used for managing devices on the internet.
It provides a set of operations for monitoring and managing the internet.
The manager is a host that controls and monitors a set of agents such as routers.
It is an application layer protocol in which a few manager stations can handle a set of agents.
The protocol designed at the application level can monitor the devices made by different manufacturers and installed on different physical networks.
It is used in a heterogeneous network made of different LANs and WANs connected by routers or gateways.
A manager is a host that runs the SNMP client program while the agent is a router that runs the SNMP server program.
Management of the internet is achieved through simple interaction between a manager and agent.
"The agent is used to keep the information in a database while the manager is used to access the values in the database. For example, a router can store the appropriate variables such as a number of packets received and forwarded while the manager can compare these variables to determine whether the router is congested or not."
"Agents can also contribute to the management process. A server program on the agent checks the environment, if something goes wrong, the agent sends a warning message to the manager."
A manager checks the agent by requesting the information that reflects the behavior of the agent.
A manager also forces the agent to perform a certain function by resetting values in the agent database.
An agent also contributes to the management process by warning the manager regarding an unusual condition.
Management is not achieved only through the SNMP protocol but also the use of other protocols that can cooperate with the SNMP protocol. Management is achieved through the use of the other two protocols: SMI (Structure of management information) and MIB(management information base).
"Management is a combination of SMI, MIB, and SNMP. All these three protocols such as abstract syntax notation 1 (ASN.1) and basic encoding rules (BER)."
The SMI (Structure of management information) is a component used in network management. Its main function is to define the type of data that can be stored in an object and to show how to encode the data for the transmission over a network.
The MIB (Management information base) is a second component for the network management.
"Each agent has its own MIB, which is a collection of all the objects that the manager can manage. MIB is categorized into eight groups: system, interface, address translation, ip, icmp, tcp, udp, and egp. These groups are under the mib object."
"SNMP defines five types of messages: GetRequest, GetNextRequest, SetRequest, GetResponse, and Trap."
GetRequest: The GetRequest message is sent from a manager (client) to the agent (server) to retrieve the value of a variable.
"GetNextRequest: The GetNextRequest message is sent from the manager to agent to retrieve the value of a variable. This type of message is used to retrieve the values of the entries in a table. If the manager does not know the indexes of the entries, then it will not be able to retrieve the values. In such situations, GetNextRequest message is used to define an object."
GetResponse: The GetResponse message is sent from an agent to the manager in response to the GetRequest and GetNextRequest message. This message contains the value of a variable requested by the manager.
SetRequest: The SetRequest message is sent from a manager to the agent to set a value in a variable.
"Trap: The Trap message is sent from an agent to the manager to report an event. For example, if the agent is rebooted, then it informs the manager as well as sends the time of rebooting."
It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
"The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on."
This protocol is known as HyperText Transfer Protocol because of its efficiency that allows us to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another document.
"HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from one host to another host. But, HTTP is simpler than FTP as HTTP uses only one connection, i.e., no control connection to transfer the files."
HTTP is used to carry the data in the form of MIME-like format.
HTTP is similar to SMTP as the data is transferred between client and server. The HTTP differs from the SMTP in the way the messages are sent from the client to the server and from server to the client. SMTP messages are stored and forwarded while HTTP messages are delivered immediately.
"Connectionless protocol: HTTP is a connectionless protocol. HTTP client initiates a request and waits for a response from the server. When the server receives the request, the server processes the request and sends back the response to the HTTP client after which the client disconnects the connection. The connection between client and server exist only during the current request and response time only."
Media independent: HTTP protocol is a media independent as data can be sent as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. It is required for both the client and server to specify the content type in MIME-type header.
"Stateless: HTTP is a stateless protocol as both the client and server know each other only during the current request. Due to this nature of the protocol, both the client and server do not retain the information between various requests of the web pages."
The above figure shows the HTTP transaction between client and server. The client initiates a transaction by sending a request message to the server. The server replies to the request message by sending a response message.
HTTP messages are of two types: request and response. Both the message types follow the same message format.
"Request Message: The request message is sent by the client that consists of a request line, headers, and sometimes a body."
"Response Message: The response message is sent by the server to the client that consists of a status line, headers, and sometimes a body."
"A client that wants to access the document in an internet needs an address and to facilitate the access of documents, the HTTP uses the concept of Uniform Resource Locator (URL)."
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a standard way of specifying any kind of information on the internet.
"The URL defines four parts: method, host computer, port, and path."
"Method: The method is the protocol used to retrieve the document from a server. For example, HTTP."
"Host: The host is the computer where the information is stored, and the computer is given an alias name. Web pages are mainly stored in the computers and the computers are given an alias name that begins with the characters ""www"". This field is not mandatory."
"Port: The URL can also contain the port number of the server, but it's an optional field. If the port number is included, then it must come between the host and path and it should be separated from the host by a colon."
Path: Path is the pathname of the file where the information is stored. The path itself contain slashes that separate the directories from the subdirectories and files.
Computer network security consists of measures taken by business or some organizations to monitor and prevent unauthorized access from the outside attackers.
"Different approaches to computer network security management have different requirements depending on the size of the computer network. For example, a home office requires basic network security while large businesses require high maintenance to prevent the network from malicious attacks."
Network Administrator controls access to the data and software on the network. A network administrator assigns the user ID and password to the authorized person.
"Privacy: Privacy means both the sender and the receiver expects confidentiality. The transmitted message should be sent only to the intended receiver while the message should be opaque for other users. Only the sender and receiver should be able to understand the transmitted message as eavesdroppers can intercept the message. Therefore, there is a requirement to encrypt the message so that the message cannot be intercepted. This aspect of confidentiality is commonly used to achieve secure communication."
"Message Integrity: Data integrity means that the data must arrive at the receiver exactly as it was sent. There must be no changes in the data content during transmission, either maliciously or accident, in a transit. As there are more and more monetary exchanges over the internet, data integrity is more crucial. The data integrity must be preserved for secure communication."
"End-point authentication: Authentication means that the receiver is sure of the sender?s identity, i.e., no imposter has sent the message."
"Non-Repudiation: Non-Repudiation means that the receiver must be able to prove that the received message has come from a specific sender. The sender must not deny sending a message that he or she send. The burden of proving the identity comes on the receiver. For example, if a customer sends a request to transfer the money from one account to another account, then the bank must have a proof that the customer has requested for the transaction."
The concept of how to achieve privacy has not been changed for thousands of years: the message cannot be encrypted. The message must be rendered as opaque to all the unauthorized parties. A good encryption/decryption technique is used to achieve privacy to some extent. This technique ensures that the eavesdropper cannot understand the contents of the message.
Encryption: Encryption means that the sender converts the original information into another form and sends the unintelligible message over the network.
Decryption: Decryption reverses the Encryption process in order to transform the message back to the original form.
"The data which is to be encrypted at the sender site is known as plaintext, and the encrypted data is known as ciphertext. The data is decrypted at the receiver site."
"In Secret Key Encryption/Decryption technique, the same key is used by both the parties, i.e., the sender and receiver."
The sender uses the secret key and encryption algorithm to encrypt the data; the receiver uses this key and decryption algorithm to decrypt the data.
"In Secret Key Encryption/Decryption technique, the algorithm used for encryption is the inverse of the algorithm used for decryption. It means that if the encryption algorithm uses a combination of addition and multiplication, then the decryption algorithm uses a combination of subtraction and division."
The secret key encryption algorithm is also known as symmetric encryption algorithm because the same secret key is used in bidirectional communication.
"In secret key encryption/decryption algorithm, the secret code is used by the computer to encrypt the information before it is sent over the network to another computer."
The secret key requires that we should know which computers are talking to each other so that we can install the key on each computer.
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was designed by IBM and adopted by the U.S. government as the standard encryption method for nonmilitary and nonclassified use.
"The Data Encryption Standard is a standard used for encryption, and it is a form of Secret Key Cryptography."
"Efficient: The secret key algorithms are more efficient as it takes less time to encrypt the message than to encrypt the message by using a public key encryption algorithm. The reason for this is that the size of the key is small. Due to this reason, Secret Key Algorithms are mainly used for encryption and decryption."
"Each pair of users must have a secret key. If the number of people wants to use this method in the world is N, then there are N(N-1)/2 secret keys. For example, for one million people, then there are half billion secret keys."
The distribution of keys among different parties can be very difficult. This problem can be resolved by combining the Secret Key Encryption/Decryption with the Public Key Encryption/Decryption algorithm.
There are two keys in public key encryption: a private key and a public key.
The private key is given to the receiver while the public key is provided to the public.
"In the above figure, we see that A is sending the message to user B. 'A' uses the public key to encrypt the data while 'B' uses the private key to decrypt the data."
"In public key Encryption/Decryption, the public key used by the sender is different from the private key used by the receiver."
The public key is available to the public while the private key is kept by each individual.
The most commonly used public key algorithm is known as RSA.
"The main restriction of private key encryption is the sharing of a secret key. A third party cannot use this key. In public key encryption, each entity creates a pair of keys, and they keep the private one and distribute the public key."
"The number of keys in public key encryption is reduced tremendously. For example, for one million users to communicate, only two million keys are required, not a half-billion keys as in the case of secret key encryption."
"Speed: One of the major disadvantage of the public-key encryption is that it is slower than secret-key encryption. In secret key encryption, a single shared key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message which speeds up the process while in public key encryption, different two keys are used, both related to each other by a complex mathematical process. Therefore, we can say that encryption and decryption take more time in public key encryption."
"Authentication: A public key encryption does not have a built-in authentication. Without authentication, the message can be interpreted or intercepted without the user's knowledge."
"Inefficient: The main disadvantage of the public key is its complexity. If we want the method to be effective, large numbers are needed. But in public key encryption, converting the plaintext into ciphertext using long keys takes a lot of time. Therefore, the public key encryption algorithms are efficient for short messages not for long messages."
"The Digital Signature is a technique which is used to validate the authenticity and integrity of the message. We know that there are four aspects of security: privacy, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. We have already discussed the first aspect of security and other three aspects can be achieved by using a digital signature."
"The basic idea behind the Digital Signature is to sign a document. When we send a document electronically, we can also sign it. We can sign a document in two ways: to sign a whole document and to sign a digest."
"In Digital Signature, a public key encryption technique is used to sign a document. However, the roles of a public key and private key are different here. The sender uses a private key to encrypt the message while the receiver uses the public key of the sender to decrypt the message."
"In Digital Signature, the private key is used for encryption while the public key is used for decryption."
Digital Signature cannot be achieved by using secret key encryption.
"Integrity: The Digital Signature preserves the integrity of a message because, if any malicious attack intercepts a message and partially or totally changes it, then the decrypted message would be impossible."
"Authentication: We can use the following reasoning to show how the message is authenticated. If an intruder (user X) sends a message pretending that it is coming from someone else (user A), user X uses her own private key to encrypt the message. The message is decrypted by using the public key of user A. Therefore this makes the message unreadable. Encryption with X's private key and decryption with A's public key results in garbage value."
"Non-Repudiation: Digital Signature also provides non-repudiation. If the sender denies sending the message, then her private key corresponding to her public key is tested on the plaintext. If the decrypted message is the same as the original message, then we know that the sender has sent the message."
"Public key encryption is efficient if the message is short. If the message is long, a public key encryption is inefficient to use. The solution to this problem is to let the sender sign a digest of the document instead of the whole document."
"The sender creates a miniature version (digest) of the document and then signs it, the receiver checks the signature of the miniature version."
The hash function is used to create a digest of the message. The hash function creates a fixed-size digest from the variable-length message.
The two most common hash functions used: MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1). The first one produces 120-bit digest while the second one produces a 160-bit digest.
"A hash function must have two properties to ensure the success:

First, the digest must be one way, i.e., the digest can only be created from the message but not vice versa.
Second, hashing is a one-to-one function, i.e., two messages should not create the same digest."
"First, the digest must be one way, i.e., the digest can only be created from the message but not vice versa."
"Second, hashing is a one-to-one function, i.e., two messages should not create the same digest."
The miniature version (digest) of the message is created by using a hash function.
The digest is encrypted by using the sender's private key.
"After the digest is encrypted, then the encrypted digest is attached to the original message and sent to the receiver."
"The receiver receives the original message and encrypted digest and separates the two. The receiver implements the hash function on the original message to create the second digest, and it also decrypts the received digest by using the public key of the sender. If both the digests are same, then all the aspects of security are preserved."
PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which is invented by Phil Zimmermann.
"PGP was designed to provide all four aspects of security, i.e., privacy, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in the sending of email."
"PGP uses a digital signature (a combination of hashing and public key encryption) to provide integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. PGP uses a combination of secret key encryption and public key encryption to provide privacy. Therefore, we can say that the digital signature uses one hash function, one secret key, and two private-public key pairs."
PGP is an open source and freely available software package for email security.
It provides confidentiality through the use of symmetric block encryption.
"It provides compression by using the ZIP algorithm, and EMAIL compatibility using the radix-64 encoding scheme."
The e-mail message is hashed by using a hashing function to create a digest.
"The digest is then encrypted to form a signed digest by using the sender's private key, and then signed digest is added to the original email message."
The original message and signed digest are encrypted by using a one-time secret key created by the sender.
The secret key is encrypted by using a receiver's public key.
Both the encrypted secret key and the encrypted combination of message and digest are sent together.
The receiver receives the combination of encrypted secret key and message digest is received.
The encrypted secret key is decrypted by using the receiver's private key to get the one-time secret key.
The secret key is then used to decrypt the combination of message and digest.
"The digest is decrypted by using the sender's public key, and the original message is hashed by using a hash function to create a digest."
Both the digests are compared if both of them are equal means that all the aspects of security are preserved.
The Administration is difficult: The different versions of PGP complicate the administration.
"Compatibility issues: Both the sender and the receiver must have compatible versions of PGP. For example, if you encrypt an email by using PGP with one of the encryption technique, the receiver has a different version of PGP which cannot read the data."
"Complexity: PGP is a complex technique. Other security schemes use symmetric encryption that uses one key or asymmetric encryption that uses two different keys. PGP uses a hybrid approach that implements symmetric encryption with two keys. PGP is more complex, and it is less familiar than the traditional symmetric or asymmetric methods."
"No Recovery: Computer administrators face the problems of losing their passwords. In such situations, an administrator should use a special program to retrieve passwords. For example, a technician has physical access to a PC which can be used to retrieve a password. However, PGP does not offer such a special program for recovery; encryption methods are very strong so, it does not retrieve the forgotten passwords results in lost messages or lost files."
"The router is a physical or virtual internetworking device that is designed to receive, analyze, and forward data packets between computer networks. A router examines a destination IP address of a given data packet, and it uses the headers and forwarding tables to decide the best way to transfer the packets. There are some popular companies that develop routers; such are Cisco, 3Com, HP, Juniper, D-Link, Nortel, etc. Some important points of routers are given below:"
"A router is used in LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) environments. For example, it is used in offices for connectivity, and you can also establish the connection between distant networks such as from Bhopal to"
It uses the routing protocol to transfer the data across a network.
"Furthermore, it is more expensive than other networking devices like switches and hubs."
"A router works on the third layer of the OSI model, and it is based on the IP address of a computer. It uses protocols such as ICMP to communicate between two or more networks. It is also known as an intelligent device as it can calculate the best route to pass the network packets from source to the destination automatically."
"A virtual router is a software function or software-based framework that performs the same functions as a physical router. It may be used to increase the reliability of the network by virtual router redundancy protocol, which is done by configuring a virtual router as a default gateway. A virtual router runs on commodity servers, and it is packaged with alone or other network functions, like load balancing, firewall packet filtering, and wide area network optimization capabilities."
"A router is more capable as compared to other network devices, such as a hub, switch, etc., as these devices are only able to execute the basic functions of the network. For example, a hub is a basic networking device that is mainly used to forward the data between connected devices, but it cannot analyze or change anything with the transferring data. On the other hand, the router has the capability to analyze and modify the data while transferring it over a network, and it can send it to another network. For example, generally, routers allow sharing a single network connection between multiple devices."
A router analyzes a destination IP address of a given packet header and compares it with the routing table to decide the packet's next path. The list of routing tables provides directions to transfer the data to a particular network destination. They have a set of rules that compute the best path to forward the data to the given IP address.
"Routers use a modem such as a cable, fiber, or DSL modem to allow communication between other devices and the internet. Most of the routers have several ports to connect different devices to the internet at the same time. It uses the routing tables to determine where to send data and from where the traffic is coming."
"A routing table mainly defines the default path used by the router. So, it may fail to find the best way to forward the data for a given packet. For example, the office router along a single default path instructs all networks to its internet services provider."
"There are two types of tables in the router that are static and dynamic. The static routing tables are configured manually, and the dynamic routing tables are updated automatically by dynamic routers based on network activity."
"A router works on the 3rd layer (Network Layer) of the OSI model, and it is able to communicate with its adjacent devices with the help of IP addresses and subnet."
"A router provides high-speed internet connectivity with the different types of ports like gigabit, fast-Ethernet, and STM link port."
It allows the users to configure the port as per their requirements in the network.
"Routers' main components are central processing unit (CPU), flash memory, RAM, Non-Volatile RAM, console, network, and interface card."
Routers are capable of routing the traffic in a large networking system by considering the sub-network as an intact network.
"Routers filter out the unwanted interference, as well as carry out the data encapsulation and decapsulation process."
Routers provide the redundancy as it always works in master and slave mode.
It allows the users to connect several LAN and WAN.
"Furthermore, a router creates various paths to forward the data."
"Routers are used to connect hardware equipment with remote location networks like BSC, MGW, IN, SGSN, and other servers."
It provides support for a fast rate of data transmission because it uses high STM links for connectivity; that's why it is used in both wired or wireless communication.
"Internet service providers widely use routers to send the data from source to destination in the form of e-mail, a web page, image, voice, or a video file. Furthermore, it can send data all over the world with the help of an IP address of the destination."
"Routers offer access restrictions. It can be configured in a way that allows for few users to access the overall data and allows others to access the few data only, which is defined for them."
"Routers are also used by software testers for WAN communications. For example, the software manager of an organization is located in Agra, and its executive is located at a different place like Pune or Bangalore. Then the router provides the executive the method to share his software tools and other applications with the manager with the help of routers by connecting their PCs to the router using WAN architecture."
"In wireless networks, by configuring VPN in routers, it can be used in the client-server model, which allows sharing the internet, video, data, voice, and hardware resources. As shown in the below picture:"
"In modern times, routers have the facility of inbuilt USB ports within the hardware. They have enough internal storage capacity. External storage devices can be used with routers to store and share data."
"Routers are used to set up the operation and maintenance center of an organization, which is known as the NOC center. All equipment at a distant location are connected by routers on optical cable at a central location, which also offer redundancy through the main link and protection link topology."
There are various types of routers in networking; such are given below:
"1. Wireless Router: Wireless routers are used to offer Wi-Fi connectivity to laptops, smartphones, and other devices with Wi-Fi network capabilities, and it can also provide standard ethernet routing for a small number of wired network systems."
"Wireless routers are capable of generating a wireless signal in your home or office, and it allows the computers to connect with routers within a range, and use the internet. If the connection is indoors, the range of the wireless router is about 150 feet, and when the connection is outdoors, then its range is up to 300 feet."
"Furthermore, you can make more secure wireless routers with a password or get your IP address. Thereafter, you can log in to your router by using a user ID and password that will come with your router."
"2. Brouter: A brouter is a combination of the bridge and a router. It allows transferring the data between networks like a bridge. And like a router, it can also route the data within a network to the individual systems. Thus, it combines these two functions of bridge and router by routing some incoming data to the correct systems while transferring the other data to another network."
"3. Core router: A core router is a type of router that can route the data within a network, but it is not able to route the data between the networks. It is a computer communication system device and the backbone of networks, as it helps to link all network devices. It is used by internet service providers (ISPs), and it also provides various types of fast and powerful data communication interfaces."
4. Edge router: An edge router is a lower-capacity device that is placed at the boundary of a network. It allows an internal network to connect with the external networks. It is also called as an access router. It uses an External BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to provides connectivity with remote networks over the internet.
"The subscriber edge router belongs to an end-user organization, and it works in a situation where it acts on a border device."
"The label edge router is used in the boundary of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. It acts as a gateway between the LAN, WAN, or the internet."
5. Broadband routers: Broadband routers are mainly used to provide high-speed internet access to computers. It is needed when you connect to the internet through phone and use voice over IP technology (VOIP).
"All broadband routers have the option of three or four Ethernet ports for connecting the laptop and desktop systems. A broadband router is configured and provided by the internet service provider (ISP). It is also known as a broadband modem, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem."
"There are so many benefits of a router, which are given below:"
"Security: Router provides the security, as LANs work in broadcast mode. The information is transmitted over the network and traverses the entire cable system. Although the data is available to each station, but the station which is specifically addressed reads the data."
"Performance enhancement: It enhances the performance within the individual network. For example, if a network has 14 workstations, and all generate approximately the same volume of traffic. The traffic of 14 workstations runs through the same cable in a single network. But if the network is divided into two sub-networks each with 7 workstations, then a load of traffic is reduced to half. As each of the networks has its own servers and hard disk, so fewer PCs will need the network cabling system."
"Reliability: Routers provide reliability. If one network gets down when the server has stopped, or there is a defect in the cable, then the router services, and other networks will not be affected. The routers separate the affected network, whereas the unaffected networks remain connected, without interrupting the work and any data loss."
"Networking Range: In networking, a cable is used to connect the devices, but its length cannot exceed 1000 meters. A router can overcome this limitation by performing the function of a repeater (Regenerating the signals). The physical range can be as per the requirement of a particular installation, as long as a router is installed before the maximum cable range exceeds."
"Routing protocols specify a way for the router to identify other routers on the network and make dynamic decisions to send all network messages. There are several protocols, which are given below:"
"Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): It is used to calculate the best route for the given packets to reach the destination, as they move via a set of connected networks. It is identified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as Interior Gateway Protocol."
"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): It helps manage how packets are routed on the internet via exchange of information between edge routers. It provides network stability for routers if one internet connection goes down while forwarding the packets, it can adapt another network connection quickly to send the packets."
"Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP): It specifies how routing information will be exchanged between gateways within an independent network. Then, the other network protocols can use the routing information to determine how transmissions should be routed."
"Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP): In this protocol, if a router is unable to find a path to a destination from the tables, it asks route to its neighbors, and they pass the query to their neighbors until a router has found the path. When the entry of routing table changes in one of the routers, it informs its neighbors only about the changes, but do not send the entire table."
"Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP): It decides how routing information can be exchanged between two neighbor gateway hosts, each of which has its own router. Additionally, it is commonly used to exchange routing table information between hosts on the internet."
"Routing Information Protocol (RIP): It determines how routers can share information while transferring traffic among connected group of local area networks. The maximum number of hops that can be allowed for RIP is 15, which restricts the size of networks that RIP can support."
"There are three primarily networking devices that connect the computers from one to another. These devices are hub, switch, and router. These all have the ability to connect one computer to another, but there is some difference between them. The difference between a hub, switch, and router are given below:"
"Hub: A hub is a basic networking device that is used to connect computers or other networking devices together. A hub does not use any routing table to send the data to the destination. Although it can identify basic errors of networks like collisions, it can be a security risk to broadcast all information to the multiple ports. As the hub is a dumb device, it does not need an IP address. Furthermore, Hubs are cheaper than a switch or router."
"Switch: A switch is a hardware device that also connects computers to each other. A switch is different as compared to a hub in that way; it handles packets of data. Whenever a switch receives a packet, it decides the device to which the packet can be sent, and sends it to that device only. A hub broadcasts the packet to all computers, but the switch does not circulate the packet to all devices, which means bandwidth is not shared with the network, and thus it increases the efficiency of the network. That's why switches are more preferred as compared to a hub."
"Router: A router is more different from a switch or hub. It is mainly used to route the data packets to another network instead of transmitting the data to the local networks only. A router is commonly found in homes and offices as it allows your network to communicate with other networks through the internet. Basically, a router provides more features to your networks like firewall, VPN, QoS, traffic monitoring, etc."
A routing table determines the path for a given packet with the help of an IP address of a device and necessary information from the table and sends the packet to the destination network. The routers have the internal memory that is known as Random Access Memory (RAM). All the information of the routing table is stored in RAM of routers.
It contains an IP address of all routers which are required to decide the way to reach the destination network.
"Furthermore, it is also contained IP addresses and subnet mask of the destination host."
There are two types of a network element in the router which are as follows:
"Control plane: A router supports a routing table that determines which path and physical interface connection should be used to send the packet. It is done by using internal pre-configured directives, which are called static routes, or by learning routes with the help of routing protocol. A routing table stores the static and dynamic routes. Then the control-plane logic eliminates the unnecessary directives from the table and constructs a forwarding information base that is used by the forwarding plane."
"Forwarding plane: A router sends data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections. It uses information stored in the packet header and matches it to entries in the FIB, which is supplied by the control plane; accordingly, it forwards the data packet to the correct network type. It is also called the user plane or data plane."
There are many points to keep in mind while buying a router:
"Type of Connection: Which kind of router should you buy depends on the type of connection you have. For example, if you want to use the internet connection from your telephone services providers like BSNL or MTNL, you will need an ADSL router. In this router, you have to use the hardware that is provided to you with your connection. Although this router may have limited functionalities on some fronts.
Alternatively, you can purchase an advanced router that allows you sharing storage, including printer over a wireless connection. If you use the connection provided by the local cable operator, you will need a non-ADSL router."
"Standard: The routers support standards like 802.11ac, 802.11n, etc. The routers that support 802.11ac standard, enhances the speed to transfer the data more than three times the speed of 802.11n standard routers. It uses the 5GHz frequency band, which is less crowded as compared to the regular 2.4GHz band. Furthermore, it also provides better network performance for file transfers and streaming media content.
The routers that support 802.11ac standard are beneficial as they are compatible with 'n' standard, by which your older devices can also work without any problem.Alternatively; you can save some money and full fill your requirements by purchasing 'n' standard routers."
"Dual-band: Most of 'n' standard routers operate in the 2.4GHz frequency, but a dual-band router is better as it supports the 5GHz band. Furthermore, it can also connect with smartphones and laptops on 5GHz, while other routers can operate over 2.4GHz only."
"USB port: Routers with USB ports allow you to plug flash drives, including printers, to share these resources over the network. These functions are suitable for a small area as they can be used within the wireless network without using the internet.
Some routers provide backup internet by 3G data dongles when your main connection goes down. But these routers work with specific brands only. So, before purchasing a router, check if it supports the dongle you are using."
Multiple antennas: External antennas are strong enough to increase the overall range of your router as well as are suitable for environments where you need signals across multiple walls or doors.
"The OSI stands for Open System Interconnection, which was developed in 1980s. It is a conceptual model used for network communication. It is not implemented entirely, but it is still referenced today. This OSI model consists of seven layers, and each layer is connected to each other. The data moves down the OSI model, and each layer adds additional information. The data moves down until it reaches the last layer of the OSI model. When the data is received at the last layer of the OSI model, then the data is transmitted over the network. Once the data is reached on the other side, then the process will get reversed."
"The TCP model stands for Transmission Control Protocol, whereas IP stands for Internet Protocol. A number of protocols that make the internet possibly comes under the TCP/IP model. Nowadays, we do not hear the name of the TCP/IP model much, we generally hear the name of the IPv4 or IPv6, but it is still valid. This model consists of 4 layers. Now, we will look at the diagrammatic representation of the TCP/IP model."
"As shown in the above diagram, the TCP/IP model has 4 layers, while the OSI model consists of 7 layers. Diagrammatically, it looks that the 4 layers of the TCP/IP model exactly fit the 7 layers of the OSI model, but this is not reality. The application layer of the TCP/IP model maps to the first three layers, i.e., application, session, and presentation layer of the OSI model. The transport layer of the TCP maps directly to the transport layer of the OSI model. The internet layer of the TCP/IP model maps directly to the network layer of the OSI model. The last two layers of the OSI model map to the network layer of the TCP/IP model. TCP/IP is the most widely used model as compared to the OSI model for providing communication between computers over the internet."
The following are the similarities between the OSI and TCP/IP model:
Both the models are the logical models and having similar architectures as both the models are constructed with the layers.
"Both the layers have defined standards, and they also provide the framework used for implementing the standards and devices."
Both models have simplified the troubleshooting process by breaking the complex function into simpler components.
"The standards and protocols which are already pre-defined; these models do not redefine them; they just reference or use them. For example, the Ethernet standards were already defined by the IEEE before the development of these models; instead of recreating them, models have used these pre-defined standards."
The function which is performed between the 'presentation' and the 'network' layer is similar to the function performed at the transport layer.
Let's see the differences between the OSI and TCP/IP model in a tabular form:
"The TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. If we want the communication between two computers and communication should be good and reliable. For example, we want to view a web page, then we expect that nothing should be missing on the page, or we want to download a file, then we require a complete file, i.e., nothing should be missing either it could be a text or an image. This can only be possible due to the TCP. It is one of the most widely used protocols over the TCP/IP network."
"Data delivery
TCP protocol ensures that the data is received correctly, no data is missing and in order. If TCP protocol is not used, then the incorrect data can be received or out of order. For example, if we try to view the web page or download a file without using TCP, then some data or images could be missing."
"Protocol
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Through the word connection-oriented, we understand that the computers first establish a connection and then do the communication. This is done by using a three-way handshake. In a three-way handshake, the first sender sends the SYN message to the receiver then the receiver sends back the SYN ACK message to confirm that the message has been received. After receiving the SYN ACK message, the sender sends the acknowledgment message to the receiver. In this way, the connection is established between the computers. Once the connection is established, the data will be delivered. This protocol guarantees the data delivery means that if the data is not received then the TCP will resend the data."
"The UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. Its working is similar to the TCP as it is also used for sending and receiving the message. The main difference is that UDP is a connectionless protocol. Here, connectionless means that no connection establishes prior to communication. It also does not guarantee the delivery of data packets. It does not even care whether the data has been received on the receiver's end or not, so it is also known as the ""fire-and-forget"" protocol. It is also known as the ""fire-and-forget"" protocol as it sends the data and does not care whether the data is received or not. UDP is faster than TCP as it does not provide the assurance for the delivery of the packets."
"Type of protocol
Both the protocols, i.e., TCP and UDP, are the transport layer protocol. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. It means that TCP requires connection prior to the communication, but the UDP does not require any connection."
"Reliability
TCP is a reliable protocol as it provides assurance for the delivery of the data. It follows the acknowledgment mechanism. In this mechanism, the sender receives the acknowledgment from the receiver and checks whether the acknowledgment is positive or negative. If the ACK is positive means, the data has been received successfully. If ACK is negative, then TCP will resend the data. It also follows the flow and error control mechanism.
UDP is an unreliable protocol as it does not ensure the delivery of the data."
"Flow Control
TCP follows the flow control mechanism that ensures a large number of packets are not sent to the receiver at the same time, while UDP does not follow the flow control mechanism."
"Ordering
TCP uses ordering and sequencing techniques to ensure that the data packets are received in the same order in which they are sent. On the other hand, UDP does not follow any ordering and sequencing technique; i.e., data can be sent in any sequence."
"Speed
Since TCP establishes a connection between a sender and receiver, performs error checking, and also guarantees the delivery of data packets while UDP neither creates a connection nor it guarantees the delivery of data packets, so UDP is faster than TCP."
"Flow of data
In TCP, data can flow in both directions means that it provides the full-duplex service. On the other hand, UDP is mainly suitable for the unidirectional flow of data."
Let's look at the differences between the TCP and UDP in a tabular form.
"TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a transport layer protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets from source to destination. It is a connection-oriented protocol that means it establishes the connection prior to the communication that occurs between the computing devices in a network. This protocol is used with an IP protocol, so together, they are referred to as a TCP/IP."
"The main functionality of the TCP is to take the data from the application layer. Then it divides the data into a several packets, provides numbering to these packets, and finally transmits these packets to the destination. The TCP, on the other side, will reassemble the packets and transmits them to the application layer. As we know that TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, so the connection will remain established until the communication is not completed between the sender and the receiver."
TCP is a transport layer protocol as it is used in transmitting the data from the sender to the receiver.
"TCP is a reliable protocol as it follows the flow and error control mechanism. It also supports the acknowledgment mechanism, which checks the state and sound arrival of the data. In the acknowledgment mechanism, the receiver sends either positive or negative acknowledgment to the sender so that the sender can get to know whether the data packet has been received or needs to resend."
This protocol ensures that the data reaches the intended receiver in the same order in which it is sent. It orders and numbers each segment so that the TCP layer on the destination side can reassemble them based on their ordering.
"It is a connection-oriented service that means the data exchange occurs only after the connection establishment. When the data transfer is completed, then the connection will get terminated."
It is a full-duplex means that the data can transfer in both directions at the same time.
TCP is a stream-oriented protocol as it allows the sender to send the data in the form of a stream of bytes and also allows the receiver to accept the data in the form of a stream of bytes. TCP creates an environment in which both the sender and receiver are connected by an imaginary tube known as a virtual circuit. This virtual circuit carries the stream of bytes across the internet.
"In the layered architecture of a network model, the whole task is divided into smaller tasks. Each task is assigned to a particular layer that processes the task. In the TCP/IP model, five layers are application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer, and physical layer. The transport layer has a critical role in providing end-to-end communication to the directly application processes. It creates 65,000 ports so that the multiple applications can be accessed at the same time. It takes the data from the upper layer, and it divides the data into smaller packets and then transmits them to the network layer."
"In TCP, the connection is established by using three-way handshaking. The client sends the segment with its sequence number. The server, in return, sends its segment with its own sequence number as well as the acknowledgement sequence, which is one more than the client sequence number. When the client receives the acknowledgment of its segment, then it sends the acknowledgment to the server. In this way, the connection is established between the client and the server."
"It provides a connection-oriented reliable service, which means that it guarantees the delivery of data packets. If the data packet is lost across the network, then the TCP will resend the lost packets."
It provides a flow control mechanism using a sliding window protocol.
It provides error detection by using checksum and error control by using Go Back or ARP protocol.
"It eliminates the congestion by using a network congestion avoidance algorithm that includes various schemes such as additive increase/multiplicative decrease (AIMD), slow start, and congestion window."
"It increases a large amount of overhead as each segment gets its own TCP header, so fragmentation by the router increases the overhead."
"Source port: It defines the port of the application, which is sending the data. So, this field contains the source port address, which is 16 bits."
"Destination port: It defines the port of the application on the receiving side. So, this field contains the destination port address, which is 16 bits."
Sequence number: This field contains the sequence number of data bytes in a particular session.
"Acknowledgment number: When the ACK flag is set, then this contains the next sequence number of the data byte and works as an acknowledgment for the previous data received. For example, if the receiver receives the segment number 'x', then it responds 'x+1' as an acknowledgment number."
"HLEN: It specifies the length of the header indicated by the 4-byte words in the header. The size of the header lies between 20 and 60 bytes. Therefore, the value of this field would lie between 5 and 15."
"Reserved: It is a 4-bit field reserved for future use, and by default, all are set to zero."
"Flags
There are six control bits or flags:

URG: It represents an urgent pointer. If it is set, then the data is processed urgently.
ACK: If the ACK is set to 0, then it means that the data packet does not contain an acknowledgment.
PSH: If this field is set, then it requests the receiving device to push the data to the receiving application without buffering it.
RST: If it is set, then it requests to restart a connection.
SYN: It is used to establish a connection between the hosts.
FIN: It is used to release a connection, and no further data exchange will happen."
"URG: It represents an urgent pointer. If it is set, then the data is processed urgently."
"ACK: If the ACK is set to 0, then it means that the data packet does not contain an acknowledgment."
"PSH: If this field is set, then it requests the receiving device to push the data to the receiving application without buffering it."
"RST: If it is set, then it requests to restart a connection."
SYN: It is used to establish a connection between the hosts.
"FIN: It is used to release a connection, and no further data exchange will happen."
"Window size
It is a 16-bit field. It contains the size of data that the receiver can accept. This field is used for the flow control between the sender and receiver and also determines the amount of buffer allocated by the receiver for a segment. The value of this field is determined by the receiver."
"Checksum
It is a 16-bit field. This field is optional in UDP, but in the case of TCP/IP, this field is mandatory."
"Urgent pointer
It is a pointer that points to the urgent data byte if the URG flag is set to 1. It defines a value that will be added to the sequence number to get the sequence number of the last urgent byte."
"Options
It provides additional options. The optional field is represented in 32-bits. If this field contains the data less than 32-bit, then padding is required to obtain the remaining bits."
"The TCP port is a unique number assigned to different applications. For example, we have opened the email and games applications on our computer; through email application, we want to send the mail to the host, and through games application, we want to play the online games. In order to do all these tasks, different unique numbers are assigned to these applications. Each protocol and address have a port known as a port number. The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocols mainly use the port numbers."
"A port number is a unique identifier used with an IP address. A port is a 16-bit unsigned integer, and the total number of ports available in the TCP/IP model is 65,535 ports. Therefore, the range of port numbers is 0 to 65535. In the case of TCP, the zero-port number is reserved and cannot be used, whereas, in UDP, the zero port is not available. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is a standard body that assigns the port numbers."
"In the above case, 192.168.1.100 is an IP address, and 7 is a port number."
"To access a particular service, the port number is used with an IP address. The range from 0 to 1023 port numbers are reserved for the standard protocols, and the other port numbers are user-defined."
"A single client can have multiple connections with the same server or multiple servers. The client may be running multiple applications at the same time. When the client tries to access some service, then the IP address is not sufficient to access the service. To access the service from a server, the port number is required. So, the transport layer plays a major role in providing multiple communication between these applications by assigning a port number to the applications."
"The range of well-known port is 0 to 1023. The well-known ports are used with those protocols that serve common applications and services such as HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), etc. For example, we want to visit some websites on an internet; then, we use http protocol; the http is available with a port number 80, which means that when we use http protocol with an application then it gets port number 80. It is defined that whenever http protocol is used, then port number 80 will be used. Similarly, with other protocols such as SMTP, IMAP; well-known ports are defined. The remaining port numbers are used for random applications."
The range of registered port is 1024 to 49151. The registered ports are used for the user processes. These processes are individual applications rather than the common applications that have a well-known port.
"The range of dynamic port is 49152 to 65535. Another name of the dynamic port is ephemeral ports. These port numbers are assigned to the client application dynamically when a client creates a connection. The dynamic port is identified when the client initiates the connection, whereas the client knows the well-known port prior to the connection. This port is not known to the client when the client connects to the service."
"As we know that both TCP and UDP contain source and destination port numbers, and these port numbers are used to identify the application or a server both at the source and the destination side. Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to pass the information to the upper layers."
Suppose a client is accessing a web page. The TCP header contains both the source and destination port.
"Source Port: The source port defines an application to which the TCP segment belongs to, and this port number is dynamically assigned by the client. This is basically a process to which the port number is assigned."
Destination port: The destination port identifies the location of the service on the server so that the server can serve the request of the client.
Source port: It defines the application from where the TCP segment came from.
Destination port: It defines the application to which the TCP segment is going to.
Encapsulation: Port numbers are used by the sender to tell the receiver which application it should use for the data.
Decapsulation: Port numbers are used by the receiver to identify which application should it sends the data to.
"Let's understand the above example by using all three ports, i.e., well-known port, registered port, and dynamic port."
"The well-known ports are the ports that serve the common services and applications like http, ftp, smtp, etc. Here, the client uses a well-known port as a destination port while the server uses a well-known port as a source port. For example, the client sends an http request, then, in this case, the destination port would be 80, whereas the http server is serving the request so its source port number would be 80."
"The registered port is assigned to the non-common applications. Lots of vendor applications use this port. Like the well-known port, client uses this port as a destination port whereas the server uses this port as a source port."
"At the end, we see how dynamic port works in this scenario."
"The dynamic port is the port that is dynamically assigned to the client application when initiating a connection. In this case, the client uses a dynamic port as a source port, whereas the server uses a dynamic port as a destination port. For example, the client sends an http request; then in this case, destination port would be 80 as it is a http request, and the source port will only be assigned by the client. When the server serves the request, then the source port would be 80 as it is an http server, and the destination port would be the same as the source port of the client. The registered port can also be used in place of a dynamic port."
"Suppose client is communicating with a server, and sending the http request. So, the client sends the TCP segment to the well-known port, i.e., 80 of the HTTP protocols. In this case, the destination port would be 80 and suppose the source port assigned dynamically by the client is 1028. When the server responds, the destination port is 1028 as the source port defined by the client is 1028, and the source port at the server end would be 80 as the HTTP server is responding to the request of the client."
"An IP stands for internet protocol. An IP address is assigned to each device connected to a network. Each device uses an IP address for communication. It also behaves as an identifier as this address is used to identify the device on a network. It defines the technical format of the packets. Mainly, both the networks, i.e., IP and TCP, are combined together, so together, they are referred to as a TCP/IP. It creates a virtual connection between the source and the destination."
"We can also define an IP address as a numeric address assigned to each device on a network. An IP address is assigned to each device so that the device on a network can be identified uniquely. To facilitate the routing of packets, TCP/IP protocol uses a 32-bit logical address known as IPv4(Internet Protocol version 4)."
"An IP address consists of two parts, i.e., the first one is a network address, and the other one is a host address."
"IPv4 is a version 4 of IP. It is a current version and the most commonly used IP address. It is a 32-bit address written in four numbers separated by 'dot', i.e., periods. This address is unique for each device."
"The above example represents the IP address in which each group of numbers separated by periods is called an Octet. Each number in an octet is in the range from 0-255. This address can produce 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses."
"In today's computer network world, computers do not understand the IP addresses in the standard numeric format as the computers understand the numbers in binary form only. The binary number can be either 1 or 0. The IPv4 consists of four sets, and these sets represent the octet. The bits in each octet represent a number."
"Each bit in an octet can be either 1 or 0. If the bit the 1, then the number it represents will count, and if the bit is 0, then the number it represents does not count."
The above representation shows the structure of 8- bit octet.
"Now, we will see how to obtain the binary representation of the above IP address, i.e., 66.94.29.13"
"Step 1: First, we find the binary number of 66."
"To obtain 66, we put 1 under 64 and 2 as the sum of 64 and 2 is equal to 66 (64+2=66), and the remaining bits will be zero, as shown above. Therefore, the binary bit version of 66 is 01000010."
"Step 2: Now, we calculate the binary number of 94."
"To obtain 94, we put 1 under 64, 16, 8, 4, and 2 as the sum of these numbers is equal to 94, and the remaining bits will be zero. Therefore, the binary bit version of 94 is 01011110."
"To obtain 29, we put 1 under 16, 8, 4, and 1 as the sum of these numbers is equal to 29, and the remaining bits will be zero. Therefore, the binary bit version of 29 is 00011101."
"To obtain 13, we put 1 under 8, 4, and 1 as the sum of these numbers is equal to 13, and the remaining bits will be zero. Therefore, the binary bit version of 13 is 00001101."
"Currently, the population of the world is 7.6 billion. Every user is having more than one device connected with the internet, and private companies also rely on the internet. As we know that IPv4 produces 4 billion addresses, which are not enough for each device connected to the internet on a planet. Although the various techniques were invented, such as variable- length mask, network address translation, port address translation, classes, inter-domain translation, to conserve the bandwidth of IP address and slow down the depletion of an IP address. In these techniques, public IP is converted into a private IP due to which the user having public IP can also use the internet. But still, this was not so efficient, so it gave rise to the development of the next generation of IP addresses, i.e., IPv6."
"IPv4 produces 4 billion addresses, and the developers think that these addresses are enough, but they were wrong. IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple header as compared to IPv4."
"It provides transition strategies that convert IPv4 into IPv6, and these strategies are as follows:"
"Dual stacking: It allows us to have both the versions, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, on the same device."
"Tunneling: In this approach, all the users have IPv6 communicates with an IPv4 network to reach IPv6."
Network Address Translation: The translation allows the communication between the hosts having a different version of IP.
"This hexadecimal address contains both numbers and alphabets. Due to the usage of both the numbers and alphabets, IPv6 is capable of producing over 340 undecillion (3.4*1038) addresses."
"IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address made up of 8 sets of 16 bits each, and these 8 sets are separated by a colon. In IPv6, each hexadecimal character represents 4 bits. So, we need to convert 4 bits to a hexadecimal number at a time"
"The above diagram shows the address format of IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 is a 32-bit decimal address. It contains 4 octets or fields separated by 'dot', and each field is 8-bit in size. The number that each field contains should be in the range of 0-255. Whereas an IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. It contains 8 fields separated by a colon, and each field is 16-bit in size."
"The address resolution protocol (ARP) uses a basic message format that contains either address resolution request or address resolution response. The ARP message size depends on the address size of the link layer and the network layer. The message header describes the network type used at each layer and the address size of each layer. The message header is complete with the help of the operation code, which is 1 for request and 2 for the response. The payload of the packet has four addresses, these are:"
The Packet format of the Address Resolution Protocol is shown in the figure:
"HTYPE (Hardware Type) - The size of the hardware type field is 16 bit. This field defines the network type that the local network needs to transmit the ARP message. There are some typical values for this field, which are given below:"
PTYPE (Protocol Type) - The protocol type is a 16-bit field used to specify the type of protocol.
HLEN (Hardware Length) - The size of the hardware length field is 8-bit. This field specifies the length of the physical address in bytes.
"Example: For this, the address length of Ethernet is 6."
PLEN (Protocol Length) - The size of the protocol length field is 8-bit long. It defines the length of the IP address in bytes.
"OPER (Operation) - It is a 16-bit field that determines the type of ARP packet. There are two types of ARP packets, i.e., ARP request and ARP Reply. In the given table, the first two values are used for the ARP request and reply. The values for the other ARP frame format such as RARP, DRARP, etc. are also specified in this table."
"SHA (Sender Hardware Address) - This field specifies the physical address of the sender, and the length of this field is not fixed."
"SPA (Sender Protocol Address) - This field is used to determine the logical address of the sender, and the length of this field is not fixed."
"THA (Target Hardware Address) - The target hardware address specifies the physical address of the target. It is a variable-length field. For the ARP request packet, this field contains all zeros because the sender does not know the physical address of the receiver."
TPA (Target Protocol Address) - This field determines the logical address of the target. TPA is a variable-length field.
"ARP Table is used to keep the record of the IP address and MAC address of the devices (source and destination device). For the communication between two devices, it is necessary that the IP address and the MAC address of the source and the destination device should be stored in an ARP table. If there is no record in the table, an ARP broadcast is sent by the source to all the devices in a network. All the devices compare their own IP address with the IP address of the destination device. When the IP address of the device matches with each other, that device sent the response, which is then updated in an ARP table. Each host that is connected to the network should have to maintain an ARP table on its own."
"Example: Suppose, many devices are connected to a switch. When these devices get connected to the router, the IP addresses of these devices get stored in the cache memory (ARP table). When the device (source) sends an ARP request, the ARP table checks the IP address connected to the device and converts the information into a packet. Then deliver the packet to the appropriate IP address."
"We can perform many operations in an ARP table such as to display, add and remove ARP entries in the ARP table (ARP cache). To perform these operations, we use an arp command offered by the Windows Operating System."
You can display the ARP entries by using the command arp -a. This list of entries is displayed in the terminal according to the interfaces.
Step 1: Go to the start menu. Open the command prompt.
"Step 2: Type arp -a command in the command prompt or terminal and press enter button. After pressing the enter button, all the ARP entries will display in the command prompt."
"The ARP table also provides a feature that is adding a static ARP entry to the AP table. With the help of this, we can add the IP address and MAC address to the ARP table (ARP cache). These entries will be stored until the computer restarts. The type of these entries will remain static when they are listed in the table."
"To add a static entry, type arp -s command along with the IP address and MAC address in a command prompt and then press enter."
"We can also remove the arp entries irrespective of the entry type, such as static and dynamic."
"Step 1: To remove an ARP entry type, the command arp -a. This command will display all the ARP entries with their IP address, MAC address, and the entry type."
"Step 2: Now, type the arp -s command along with the IP address, which we want to delete and then press enter. It is necessary that the IP address must be from the listed entries."
"In the above example, we have deleted the entry having IP address 192.168.43.255."
"Step 3: To check whether the entry is deleted or not again type arp -a command and press enter key. After pressing enter key, all the entries will be displayed in the command prompt except the deleted one."
"In the above figure, the entry having IP address 192.168.43.255 is not present."
"Mostly, the computer programs use IP address (Logical address) to send or receive messages, hence the actual communication takes place over physical address (MAC address). So our aim is to find out the MAC address of the destination that allows us to communicate with other devices. In this case, the ARP is actually required as it converts the IP address to a physical address."
"At the network layer, when the source wants to communicate with the destination. Firstly, the source needs to find out the MAC address (Physical Address) of the destination. For this, the source will check the ARP cache and ARP table for the MAC address of the destination. If the MAC address of the destination is present in the ARP cache or ARP table, then the source uses that MAC address for the communication."
"If the MAC address of the destination is not in the ARP cache or ARP table, then the Source generates an ARP Request message. The ARP Request message consists of the MAC address and the IP address of the source. It also contains the IP address and MAC address of the destination. The MAC address of the destination left null because the user has requested this."
"The ARP Request message will be broadcasted to the local network by the source computer. All the devices in the LAN network receive the broadcast message. Now, each device compares its own IP address with the IP address of the destination. If the IP address of the device match with the IP address of the destination, then that device will send an ARP to reply message. If the IP address of the device does not match the IP address of the destination, then the device will automatically drop the packet."
The destination sends an ARP reply packet when the destination address matches the device. That ARP Reply packet consists of the MAC address of the device. The destination device automatically updates the table and stores the source's MAC address because this address will be required for the communication from the source.
"Now the source acts as a target for the destination device, and the destination device sends the ARP Reply message."
The ARP Reply message is unicast instead of broadcast. This is because the device (destination) that is sending the ARP Reply message knows the MAC address of the device (source) to which the ARP Reply message is sent.
"When the source device receives the ARP Reply message, then it will know the MAC address of the destination because the ARP Reply packet contains the MAC address of the destination along with the other addresses. The source will update the MAC address of the destination in the ARP cache. Now the sender is able to communicate directly to the destination."
We can easily find out the MAC address of the device if we know the IP address of that device.
It is not necessary to configure the address of the end nodes for the MAC address. We can find it when needed.
ARP attacks such as ARP spoofing and ARP denial of service may occur.
The File transfer protocol client (FTP client) is a software that is designed to transfer the data between a system and server on the internet. This software works when it is installed on your computer. FTP client software can only be used with the help of the internet.
"It is based on the client/server architecture, where the host system is a client, and the remote server is a central server. FTP client helps a user to connect to a remote system. It allows data to be upload or download. The uploading or downloading of the data is very easy with the help of an FTP. The installation of the FTP Client depends on your OS (operating system). It is not a complicated process. There are three components of the FTP Client: the user interface, control process, and data transfer process. It supports different IP protocols such as SSH, FTPS (FTP over SSL), FXP (Site2site transfer), etc."
"If the download fails for any reason, you can resume that downloading with the help of FTP client software."
FTP client is very useful for those people whose internet speed is very slow.
"If you want to upload your data to the server with the help of the FTP client, you must use the right login details, including your FTP host_name, user_name, and password."
It allows for transferring multiple data as well as directories.
"If the download fails, you can resume that downloading with the help of FTP client software."
It allows us to add the data to a queue to be upload or download.
FTP client is very useful for those people whose internet speed is very slow.
"In this, several clients have scripting abilities via the CMD (command line)."
It is difficult to filter the active FTP connection on the local device (passive is preferred).
The server can be malformed to send the file to random ports on unexpected devices.
FTP is used to transfer the files from one device to another device on the Internet. FTP command is very useful to the FTP client.
The computer which uses FTP to transfer data is called the FTP server. It stores and shares client data. Every day thousands of files on the Internet are transferred from one computer to another. Most of these files are transferred via the FTP server. It is an essential component of the FTP architecture.
"The FTP server stores the address of client files and creates a link to share these files. An FTP server requires a transfer control protocol network or internet protocol network to function. FTP server connection remains connected to FTP clients all the time. It helps in transferring files from one user to another via the Internet. Any user can access the data stored in the FTP server, while some files can be accessed by special users."
"It can be considered as the middle layer between the user system and the data. When you transfer the file using the FTP, it is either uploaded or downloaded to the FTP server. The data is transferred from the user system to the FTP server if the user is uploading the data. The data is transferred from the FTP server to the user system if the user is downloading the data."
"For example, when you request any webpage on a web browser, the browser uses the FTP to respond to your request."
"Anonymous server is a common FTP server, that is for all FTP clients. There is no password required to access this server. Most FTP clients use it."
"The non-Anonymous server is a paid server. If the user uses the non-anonymous server,the user needs the password to access the file."
"It provides anonymous access, which means that it permits the user to download data from the server, but it prevents the uploading of the data to the server."
FTP server is very useful for those people whose internet speed is very slow.
"If the download fails for any reason in the FTP server, you can resume that downloading."
The FTP server provides ultimate protection for client data. It gives you the added assurance that your data won't fall into the wrong hands because it stores your data in the encrypted form.
"If the download fails for any reason in the FTP server, you can resume that downloading."
"In an FTP server, there is no memory limit to store data."
"The I2C stands for the inter integrated controller. The I2C protocol is a serial communication protocol that is used to connect low-speed devices. For example, EEPROMs, microcontrollers, A/D and D/A converters, and input/output interfaces. It was developed by Philips semiconductor in 1980 for inter-chip communication. Almost all major IC manufacturers now use it. It is a master-slave communication in which you can connect and control multiple slaves from a single master. In this, each slave device has a particular address. It supports various data rates according to versions ranging from 100 Kbps, 400 Kbps, 1 Mbps to 3.4 Mbps. It is synchronous communication like SPI."
"I2C protocol uses only two cables for the communication in which one cable is used for the data (SDA), and another cable is used for clock (SCL). Both cables are required to pull up with a resistor for + Vdd. It can be used to link two I2C buses with different voltages."
It is the best choice for those applications that require less costly and easy implementation rather than high-speed.
It can accommodate several master interactions through arbitration and collision detection.
The complexity of hardware increases when no. of master/slave devices are high in the circuit.
"Many devices have multiple addresses stored, which can cause conflicts."
The sliding window is a technique for sending multiple frames at a time. It controls the data packets between the two devices where reliable and gradual delivery of data frames is needed. It is also used in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
"In this technique, each frame has sent from the sequence number. The sequence numbers are used to find the missing data in the receiver end. The purpose of the sliding window technique is to avoid duplicate data, so it uses the sequence number."
"Go-Back-N ARQ protocol is also known as Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request. It is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method. In this, if any frame is corrupted or lost, all subsequent frames have to be sent again."
"The size of the sender window is N in this protocol. For example, Go-Back-8, the size of the sender window, will be 8. The receiver window size is always 1."
"If the receiver receives a corrupted frame, it cancels it. The receiver does not accept a corrupted frame. When the timer expires, the sender sends the correct frame again. The design of the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol is shown below."
The example of Go-Back-N ARQ is shown below in the figure.
"Selective Repeat ARQ is also known as the Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request. It is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method. The Go-back-N ARQ protocol works well if it has fewer errors. But if there is a lot of error in the frame, lots of bandwidth loss in sending the frames again. So, we use the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol. In this protocol, the size of the sender window is always equal to the size of the receiver window. The size of the sliding window is always greater than 1."
"If the receiver receives a corrupt frame, it does not directly discard it. It sends a negative acknowledgment to the sender. The sender sends that frame again as soon as on the receiving negative acknowledgment. There is no waiting for any time-out to send that frame. The design of the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol is shown below."
The example of the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol is shown below in the figure.
"SNMP was defined by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). It is used to manage the network. It is an internet standard protocol that monitors devices in IP networks and collects and organizes the information (data) of these devices. SNMP is supported by most network devices such as the hub, switch, router, bridge, server, modem, and printer, etc."
"The concept of SNMP is based on the manager and agent. A manager is like a host that controls a group of agents, such as routers."
"SNMP Manager: It is a computer system that monitors network traffic by the SNMP agent, and it queries these agents, takes answers, and controls them."
SNMP Agent: It is a software program that is located in a network element. It collects real-time information from the device and passes this information to the SNMP manager.
SNMP:It defines the structure of packets that is shared between a manager and an agent.
SMI (Structure of Management Information): SMI is a network management component that defines the standard rules for the naming object and object type (including range and length) and also shows how to encode objects and values.
MIB (Management Information Base): MIB is the second component of the network management. It is virtual information storage where management information is stored.
GetRequest: The GetRequest operation is used by the SNMP manager to derive one or more values from the SNMP agent.
"GetNextRequest: The GetNextRequest is similar to the GetRequest operation, but it is used to get the next value from the SNMP agent."
SetRequest: It is used by the manager to set the value of the agent device.
Trap: This command is used by the SNMP agent to send acknowledgment messages to the SNMP manager.
GetBulkRequest: It is used by the SNMP manager to retrieve the large data from the SNMP agent.
"The SNMP sends instructions and messages using both port 161 and port 162. The SNMP agent uses the port 161, and the SNMP manager uses the port 162."
"SPI stands for the Serial Peripheral Interface. It is a serial communication protocol that is used to connect low-speed devices. It was developed by Motorola in the mid-1980 for inter-chip communication. It is commonly used for communication with flash memory, sensors, real-time clock (RTC), analog-to-digital converters, and more. It is a full-duplex synchronous serial communication, which means that data can be simultaneously transmitted from both directions."
The main advantage of the SPI is to transfer the data without any interruption. Many bits can be sent or received at a time in this protocol.
"In this protocol, devices are communicated in the master-slave relationship. The master device controls the slave device, and the slave device takes the instruction from the master device. The simplest configuration of the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a combination of a single slave and a single master. But, one master device can control multiple slave devices."
The SPI protocol uses the four wires for the communication. There are shown in the figure.
MOSI: MOSI stands for Master Output Slave Input. It is used to send data from the master to the slave.
MISO: MISO stands for Master Input Slave Output. It is used to send data from the slave to the master.
SCK or SCLK (Serial Clock): It is used to the clock signal.
SS/CS (Slave Select / Chip Select): It is used by the master to send data by selecting a slave.
The main advantage of the SPI is to transfer the data without any interruption.
There is no need for a unique address of the slave in this protocol.
This protocol does not require precise oscillation of slave devices because it uses the master's clock.
"It has separate lines of MISO and MOSI, so the data can be sent and received at the same time."
It does not give any acknowledgment that the data is received or not.
"Others: Camera Lens Mount, Touchscreen, LCD, RTC, video game controller, etc."
"Here, IP stands for internet protocol. It is a protocol defined in the TCP/IP model used for sending the packets from source to destination. The main task of IP is to deliver the packets from source to the destination based on the IP addresses available in the packet headers. IP defines the packet structure that hides the data which is to be delivered as well as the addressing method that labels the datagram with a source and destination information."
"An IP protocol provides the connectionless service, which is accompanied by two transport protocols, i.e., TCP/IP and UDP/IP, so internet protocol is also known as TCP/IP or UDP/IP."
"The first version of IP (Internet Protocol) was IPv4. After IPv4, IPv6 came into the market, which has been increasingly used on the public internet since 2006."
"The development of the protocol gets started in 1974 by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf. It is used in conjunction with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), so they together named the TCP/IP."
"The first major version of the internet protocol was IPv4, which was version 4. This protocol was officially declared in RFC 791 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1981."
"After IPv4, the second major version of the internet protocol was IPv6, which was version 6. It was officially declared by the IETF in 1998. The main reason behind the development of IPv6 was to replace IPv4. There is a big difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, while IPv6 uses 128 bits for addressing."
"The main function of the internet protocol is to provide addressing to the hosts, encapsulating the data into a packet structure, and routing the data from source to the destination across one or more IP networks. In order to achieve these functionalities, internet protocol provides two major things which are given below."
"Before an IP packet is sent over the network, two major components are added in an IP packet, i.e., header and a payload."
An IP header contains lots of information about the IP packet which includes:
Source IP address: The source is the one who is sending the data.
Destination IP address: The destination is a host that receives the data from the sender.
TTL (Time to Live): The number of hops occurs before the packet gets discarded.
"Transport protocol: The transport protocol used by the internet protocol, either it can be TCP or UDP."
"There is a total of 14 fields exist in the IP header, and one of them is optional."
Payload: Payload is the data that is to be transported.
"IP routing is a process of determining the path for data so that it can travel from the source to the destination. As we know that the data is divided into multiple packets, and each packet will pass through a web of the router until it reaches the final destination. The path that the data packet follows is determined by the routing algorithm. The routing algorithm considers various factors like the size of the packet and its header to determine the efficient route for the data from the source to the destination. When the data packet reaches some router, then the source address and destination address are used with a routing table to determine the next hop's address. This process goes on until it reaches the destination. The data is divided into multiple packets so all the packets will travel individually to reach the destination."
"For example, when an email is sent from the email server, then the TCP layer in this email server divides the data into multiple packets, provides numbering to these packets and transmits them to the IP layer. This IP layer further transmits the packet to the destination email server. On the side of the destination server, the IP layer transmits these data packets to the TCP layer, and the TCP layer recombines these data packets into the message. The message is sent to the email application."
"An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to the computer which is connected to the internet. Each IP address consists of a series of characters like 192.168.1.2. Users cannot access the domain name of each website with the help of these characters, so DNS resolvers are used that convert the human-readable domain names into a series of characters. Each IP packet contains two addresses, i.e., the IP address of the device, which is sending the packet, and the IP address of the device which is receiving the packet."
"The public address is also known as an external address as they are grouped under the WAN addresses. We can also define the public address as a way to communicate outside the network. This address is used to access the internet. The public address available on our computer provides the remote access to our computer. With the help of a public address, we can set up the home server to access the internet. This address is generally assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider)."
"The scope of the public address is global, which means that we can communicate outside the network."
This address is assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider).
"We can get the Public IP by typing on Google ""What is my IP""."
"A private address is also known as an internal address, as it is grouped under the LAN addresses. It is used to communicate within the network. These addresses are not routed on the internet so that no traffic can come from the internet to this private address. The address space for the private address is allocated using InterNIC to create our own network. The private addresses are assigned to mainly those computers, printers, smartphones, which are kept inside the home or the computers that are kept within the organization. For example, a private address is assigned to the printer, which is kept inside our home, so that our family member can take out the print from the printer."
"If the computer is assigned with a private address, then the devices available within the local network can view the computer through the private ip address. However, the devices available outside the local network cannot view the computer through the private IP address, but they can access the computer if they know the router's public address. To access the computer directly, NAT (Network Address Translator) is to be used."
"Its scope is local, as we can communicate within the network only."
It is generally used for creating a local area network.
"We can get to know the private IP address by simply typing the ""ipconfig"" on the command prompt."
"The ARP commands to view, display, or modify the details/information in an ARP table/cache."
"The ARP cache or table has the dynamic list of IP and MAC addresses of those devices to which your computer has communicated recently in a local network. The purpose of maintaining an ARP table is that when you want to communicate with another device, your device does not need to send the ARP request for the MAC address of that device."
The ARP commands also helps to find out the duplicate IP address and invalid entries in an ARP table/cache.
arp -a: This command is used to display the ARP table for a particular IP address. It also shows all the entries of the ARP cache or table.
arp -g: This command works the same as the arp -a command.
"arp -d: This command is used when you want to delete an entry from the ARP table for a particular interface. To delete an entry, write arp -d command along with the IP address in a command prompt you want to delete."
arp -d *: You can also delete all the entries from the ARP table. This command will remove or flush all the entries from the table.
"arp -s: This command is used to add the static entry in the ARP table, which resolves the InetAddr (IP address) to the EtherAddr (physical address). To add a static entry in an ARP table, write arp -s command along with the IP address and MAC address of the device in a command prompt."
/?: This command is used to show the help at the command prompt.
"arp purge-delay: The arp purge-delay command delays the purging in the ARP entries in an ARP table/cache when the interface goes down or slows down. When the interface comes up within the delay time, the ARP entries are restored, and packet loss with ECMP (Equal Cost Multipath) is restricted."
no arp purge-delay: This command is used to turn off the purge delay.
"arp timeout: This command is used to determine how long the dynamic entries learned on the interface resides in the ARP cache. This command is also used in the interface configuration mode. When the timeout of an interface changes, this change only applies to that particular interface."
"show interface: This command is used to show the ARP timeout value. The format of the timeout value is hours: minutes: seconds.
clear arp cache: This command deletes/removes all the dynamic entries from the ARP table.

"ARP stands for address resolution protocol. This protocol is used to find the MAC address of the device corresponding to its IP address. This protocol aims to create communication between two devices on a local area network (Ethernet) by providing the other device's MAC address. To establish communication between two devices, the source device needs to generate the ARP request message."
"When two devices (say, source and destination) want to communicate with each other in a local area network (Ethernet). The source device knows the IP address of the destination device but not the MAC address of the destination device. To know the MAC address, the source device looks up into the ARP cache (Table). If the MAC address of the device is stored in the ARP cache them the source will use that address and start communication."
The source device generates an ARP request message if the MAC address of the destination is not stored in the ARP cache. This ARP request consists of the IP and MAC addresses of both the device source and destination. The Mac address field of the destination device is kept empty.
"The ARP request message is broadcast on the local area network (Ethernet). All the devices present on the network receive the ARP request message and compare their IP address with the source device's IP address. When the IP address of the source device matched with any of the devices on the local area network, then that device will generate an ARP reply message. If the IP address of the source device does not match with any of the devices present on the local area network, then the devices will automatically drop the packet."
The ARP reply message is then sent to the source device. The ARP reply message consists of the MAC address of the destination device.
"When the source device receives the ARP reply message, the MAC address obtained by the ARP reply message will be updated in the ARP cache along with its IP address."
"The reason behind the maintaining ARP table is that when the source device wants to communicate with the device to which the source had communicated before at that time, the source does not need to broadcast ARP request message again. The information is already stored in the ARP cache until the system reboot again. The source device has to look up the ARP cache and obtain the MAC address of the device from there."
There are some important points related to the ARP request are given below:
"The ARP request is broadcast in nature, but the ARP reply is unicast."
The MAC address of the device is kept null because the source has requested for it.
The ARP cache has less memory storage. So it deletes its entries periodically to free up space.
"If the device does not know its IP address, then it uses RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) instead of ARP and broadcast the RARP request."
"The need for an ARP request arises when a device wants to know the MAC address of the device to which the source wants to communicate with. It is necessary for both the devices to know each other's both the IP and MAC address. Each device in a network knows the IP address of the other devices but not the MAC address. So, the ARP request is generated by the source device to obtain the destination device's MAC address."
"ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the MAC address of the device from its known IP address. This means, the source device already knows the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination device. The MAC address of the device is required because you cannot communicate with a device in a local area network (Ethernet) without knowing its MAC address. So, the Address Resolution Protocol helps to obtain the MAC address of the destination device."
Scenario 1: When the data packet is lost or erroneous.
"The purpose of ARP is to convert the 32-bit logical address (IPv4 address) to the 48-bit physical address (MAC address). This protocol works between layer 2 and layer 3 of the OSI model. The MAC address resides at layer 2, which is also known as the data link layer and IP address resides at layer 3, this layer is also known as the network layer."
"Example: Suppose two devices (device A and device B) want to communicate with each other. The device A already knows the IP address of the Device B. But in order to communicate with the device B, device A still needs the MAC address of the device B. The IP address is used to locate a device on a local area network and the MAC address is used to identify the actual device. The device A first look at its internal list known as ARP cache (table) to check if the IP address of the device B already consists of its MAC address or not. If the ARP table consists of the MAC address of the device B, then device A simply use that MAC address and start communication."
"If the table does not consist of the MAC address of device B, then device A sends an ARP broadcast message on the network to know which device has that specific IP address and ask for the MAC address of that particular device. Then the device that has matching IP address to the source address sends an ARP response message that consists of the MAC address of the device B. When device A obtains the MAC address of the device B, it will store the information in the ARP cache (table). The ARP cache is used to make the network more efficient. It stores the IP address of the device along with its MAC address. The stored information is used when device A wants to communicate with device B on a network, and it does not need to broadcast a message on the network again. It will simply check the ARP cache for the entries and then use it for communication."
"There are two different ways to map the IP address into the MAC address, which are given below:"
"Static Mapping - In the static mapping, a table consists of a logical address and corresponding physical address of the destination device. In this, the IP and MAC address of the device is entered manually in an ARP table. The source device has to access the table first if a source wants to communicate with the destination device."
"Dynamic Mapping - In the dynamic mapping, if a device knows the logical address of the other device, then by using the Address Resolution protocol, this device will also find the physical address of the device. The dynamic entries are created automatically when the source device sends an ARP broadcast request. These entries are not permanent and cleared periodically."
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used to find the MAC (Media Access Control) address of a device from its IP address. This protocol is used when a device wants to communicate with another device on a Local Area Network or Ethernet.
"There are four types of Address Resolution Protocol, which is given below:"
Proxy ARP - Proxy ARP is a method through which a Layer 3 devices may respond to ARP requests for a target that is in a different network from the sender. The Proxy ARP configured router responds to the ARP and map the MAC address of the router with the target IP address and fool the sender that it is reached at its destination.
"At the backend, the proxy router sends its packets to the appropriate destination because the packets contain the necessary information."
"Example - If Host A wants to transmit data to Host B, which is on the different network, then Host A sends an ARP request message to receive a MAC address for Host B. The router responds to Host A with its own MAC address pretend itself as a destination. When the data is transmitted to the destination by Host A, it will send to the gateway so that it sends to Host B. This is known as proxy ARP."
"Gratuitous ARP - Gratuitous ARP is an ARP request of the host that helps to identify the duplicate IP address. It is a broadcast request for the IP address of the router. If an ARP request is sent by a switch or router to get its IP address and no ARP responses are received, so all other nodes cannot use the IP address allocated to that switch or router. Yet if a router or switch sends an ARP request for its IP address and receives an ARP response, another node uses the IP address allocated to the switch or router."
There are some primary use cases of gratuitous ARP that are given below:
The gratuitous ARP is used to update the ARP table of other devices.
It also checks whether the host is using the original IP address or a duplicate one.
Reverse ARP (RARP) - It is a networking protocol used by the client system in a local area network (LAN) to request its IPv4 address from the ARP gateway router table. A table is created by the network administrator in the gateway-router that is used to find out the MAC address to the corresponding IP address.
"When a new system is set up or any machine that has no memory to store the IP address, then the user has to find the IP address of the device. The device sends a RARP broadcast packet, including its own MAC address in the address field of both the sender and the receiver hardware. A host installed inside of the local network called the RARP-server is prepared to respond to such type of broadcast packet. The RARP server is then trying to locate a mapping table entry in the IP to MAC address. If any entry matches the item in the table, then the RARP server sends the response packet along with the IP address to the requesting computer."
"Inverse ARP (InARP) - Inverse ARP is inverse of the ARP, and it is used to find the IP addresses of the nodes from the data link layer addresses. These are mainly used for the frame relays, and ATM networks, where Layer 2 virtual circuit addressing are often acquired from Layer 2 signaling. When using these virtual circuits, the relevant Layer 3 addresses are available."
"ARP conversions Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses. However, its opposite address can be defined by InARP. The InARP has a similar packet format as ARP, but operational codes are different."
"The TCP retransmission means resending the packets over the network that have been either lost or damaged. Here, retransmission is a mechanism used by protocols such as TCP to provide reliable communication. Here, reliable communication means that the protocol guarantees packet's delivery even if the data packet has been lost or damaged."
The networks are unreliable and do not guarantee the delay or the retransmission of the lost or damaged packets. The network which uses a combination of acknowledgment and retransmission of damaged or lost packets offers reliability.
"Here, retransmission means the data packets have been lost, which leads to a lack of acknowledgment. This lack of acknowledgment triggers a timer to timeout, which leads to the retransmission of data packets. Here, the timer means that if no acknowledgment is received before the timer expires, the data packet is retransmitted."
Scenario 1: When the data packet is lost or erroneous.
"In this scenario, the packet is sent to the receiver, but no acknowledgment is received within that timeout period. When the timeout period expires, then the packet is resent again. When the packet is retransmitted, the acknowledgment is received. Once the acknowledgment is received, retransmission will not occur again."
Scenario 2: When the packet is received but the acknowledgment is lost.
"In this scenario, the packet is received on the other side, but the acknowledgment is lost, i.e., the ACK is not received on the sender side. Once the timeout period expires, the packet is resent. There are two copies of the packets on the other side; though the packet is received correctly, the acknowledgment is not received, so the sender retransmits the packet. In this case, the retransmission could have been avoided, but due to the loss of the ACK, the packet is retransmitted."
"In this scenario, the packet is sent, but due to the delay in acknowledgment or timeout has occurred before the actual timeout, the packet is retransmitted. In this case, the packet has been sent again unnecessarily due to the delay in acknowledgment or the timeout has been set earlier than the actual timeout."
"In the above scenarios, the first scenario cannot be avoided, but the other two scenarios can be avoided. Let's see how we can avoid these situations."
The sender sets the timeout period for an ACK. The timeout period can be of two types:
"Too short: If the timeout period is too short, then the retransmissions will be wasted."
"Too long: If the timeout period is too long, then there will be an excessive delay when the packet is lost."
"In order to overcome the above two situations, TCP sets the timeout as a function of the RTT (round trip time) where round trip time is the time required for the packet to travel from the source to the destination and then come back again."
"The RTT can vary depending upon the network's characteristics, i.e., if the network is congested, it means that the RTT is very high. We can estimate the RTT by simply watching the ACKs."
We will use the original algorithm to measure the RTT.
"Step 1: First, we measure the SampleRTT for each segment or ACK pair. When the sender sends the packet, then we know the timer at which the packet is sent, and also, we know the timer at which acknowledgment is received. Calculate the time between these two, and that becomes the SampleRTT."
"Step 2: We will not take only one sample. We will keep on taking different samples and calculate the weighted average of these samples, and this becomes the EstRTT (Estimated RTT)."
The timeout is set to be twice the estimated RTT. This is how the actual timeout factor is calculated.
There is a flaw in the original algorithm. Let's consider two scenarios.
"The above diagram shows that the sender sends the data, which is said to be an original transmission. Within the timeout period, no acknowledgment is received. So, the sender retransmits the data. After retransmitting the data, the acknowledgment is received. Let's assume that acknowledgment is received for the original transmission, not for the retransmission. Since we get the acknowledgment of the original transmission, so SampleRTT is calculated between the time of the original transmission and the time at which the acknowledgment is received. But actually, the SampleRTT should have been between the time of the retransmission and time of the acknowledgment."
"The above diagram shows that the sender sends the original data packet for which we get the acknowledgment also. But the acknowledgment is received after retransmitting the data. If we assume that acknowledgment belongs to the retransmission, then SampleRTT is calculated between the time of the retransmission and the time of the acknowledgment."
"In the above both the scenarios, there is an ambiguity of not knowing whether the acknowledgment is for the original transmission or for the retransmission."
"Here, ACK does not mean to acknowledge a transmission, but actually, it acknowledges a receipt of the data."
"If we consider the first scenario, the retransmission is done for the lost packet. In this case, we are assuming that ACK belongs to the original transmission due to which the SampleRTT is coming out to be very large."
"If we consider the second scenario, two same packets are sent so duplicity occurs in this case. In this case, we are assuming that ACK belongs to the retransmission due to which the SampleRTT is coming to be very small."
"To overcome the above problems, a simple solution is given by the Karn/Partridge algorithm. This algorithm gave a simple solution that collects the samples sent at one time and does not consider the samples at the retransmission time for calculating the estimated RTT."
"In the above two scenarios, retransmission occurs, and we have considered the Sample RTT. But this algorithm does not consider the Sample RTT when retransmitting. Since the retransmission has occurred, which means that something happens in this round-trip time or some congestion may occur in a network. To overcome this problem, this algorithm doubles the timeout after each retransmission. This algorithm is implemented in the TCP network."
"If the variance is small, the EstimatedRTT comes out to be accurate. If the variance is large, the EstimatedRTT is not accurate."
"To overcome the above limitation, the Jacobson/Karels algorithm was developed that introduces the variance factor in RTT."
"This algorithm was developed to overcome the limitation of the Karn/Partridge algorithm. It computes the difference between the SampleRTT and EstimatedRTT, and boost the RTT based on the difference."
"Now, we calculate the EstimatedRTT, which will be calculated in the same way as we did above."
"Here, Dev is a deviation factor, and δ is a factor between 0 and 1. The Dev is an estimate of the variance from the EstRTT."
We will consider the variance while calculating the timeout value.
"The timeout-based strategy for retransmission is inefficient. TCP is a sliding-window kind of protocol, so whenever the retransmission occurs, it starts sending it from the lost packet onward."
"Suppose I transmit the packets 0, 1, 2, and 3. Since packet 0 and packet 1 are received on the other side, packet 2 is lost in a network. I have received the acknowledgment of packet 0 and packet 1, so I send two more packets, i.e., packet 4 and packet 5. When packets 3, 4, and 5 are sent, then I will get the acknowledgment of packet 1 as TCP acknowledgments are cumulative, so it acknowledges up to the packet that it has received in order. I have not received the acknowledgment of packet 2, 3,4, and 5 within the timeout period, so I retransmit the packets 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since packet 2 is lost, but other packets, i.e., 3, 4,5 are received on the other side, they are still retransmitted because of this timeout mechanism."
"Suppose n packet has been lost, but still, the packets n+1, n+2, and so on have been received. The receiver is continuously receiving the packets and sending the ACK packets saying that the receiver is still awaiting the nth packet. The receiver is sending repeated or duplicate acknowledgments. In the above case, ACK of packet 1 is sent three-time as packet 2 has been lost. This duplicate ACK packet is an indication that the nth packet is missing, but the later packets are received."
The above situation can be solved in the following ways:
"The sender can take the ""duplicate ACKs"" as an early hint that the nth packet has been lost so that the sender can do the retransmission as early as possible, i.e., the sender should not wait until the timeout occurs."
"The sender can implement a fast transmission strategy in TCP. In a fast transmission strategy, the sender should consider the triple duplicate ACKs as a trigger and retransmit it."
"TCP uses three duplicate ACKs as a trigger and then performs retransmission. In the above case, when three ACKs of packet 1 are received, then the sender should send the lost packet, i.e., packet 2, without waiting for the timeout period to occur."
"CAN stands for Controller Area Network protocol. It is a protocol that was developed by Robert Bosch in around 1986. The CAN protocol is a standard designed to allow the microcontroller and other devices to communicate with each other without any host computer. The feature that makes the CAN protocol unique among other communication protocols is the broadcast type of bus. Here, broadcast means that the information is transmitted to all the nodes. The node can be a sensor, microcontroller, or a gateway that allows the computer to communicate over the network through the USB cable or ethernet port. The CAN is a message-based protocol, which means that message carries the message identifier, and based on the identifier, priority is decided. There is no need for node identification in the CAN network, so it becomes very easy to insert or delete it from the network. It is a serial half-duplex and asynchronous type of communication protocol. The CAN is a two-wired communication protocol as the CAN network is connected through the two-wired bus. The wires are twisted pair having 120Ω characteristics impedance connected at each end. Initially, it was mainly designed for communication within the vehicles, but it is now used in many other contexts. Like UDS, and KWP 2000, CAN also be used for the on-board diagnostics."
"The need for a centralized standard communication protocol came because of the increase in the number of electronic devices. For example, there can be more than 7 TCU for various subsystems such as dashboard, transmission control, engine control unit, and many more in a modern vehicle. If all the nodes are connected one-to-one, then the speed of the communication would be very high, but the complexity and cost of the wires would be very high. In the above example, a single dashboard requires 8 connectors, so to overcome this issue, CAN was introduced as a centralized solution that requires two wires, i.e., CAN high and CAN low. The solution of using CAN protocol is quite efficient due to its message prioritization, and flexible as a node can be inserted or removed without affecting the network."
"Initially, CAN protocol was designed to target the communication issue that occurs within the vehicles. But later on, due to the features it offers, it is used in various other fields. The following are the applications of CAN protocol:"
"As we know that the OSI model partitions the communication system into 7 different layers. But the CAN layered architecture consists of two layers, i.e., data-link layer and physical layer."
"Data-link layer: This layer is responsible for node to node data transfer. It allows you to establish and terminate the connection. It is also responsible for detecting and correcting the errors that may occur at the physical layer.
Data-link layer is subdivided into two sub-layers:

MAC: MAC stands for Media Access Control. It defines how devices in a network gain access to the medium. It provides Encapsulation and Decapsulation of data, Error detection, and signaling.
LLC: LLC stands for Logical link control. It is responsible for frame acceptance filtering, overload notification, and recovery management."
"MAC: MAC stands for Media Access Control. It defines how devices in a network gain access to the medium. It provides Encapsulation and Decapsulation of data, Error detection, and signaling."
"LLC: LLC stands for Logical link control. It is responsible for frame acceptance filtering, overload notification, and recovery management."
"Physical layer: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission of raw data. It defines the specifications for the parameters such as voltage level, timing, data rates, and connector."
"CAN specifications define CAN protocol and CAN physical layer, which are defined in the CAN standard ISO 11898. ISO 11898 has three parts:"
ISO 11898-1: This part contains the specification of the Data-link layer and physical signal link.
ISO 11898-2: This part comes under CAN physical layer for high speed CAN. The high- speed CAN allows data rate upto 1 Mbps used in the power train and the charges area of the vehicle.
"ISO 11898-3: This part also comes under CAN physical layer for low-speed CAN. It allows data rate upto 125 kbps, and the low speed CAN is used where the speed of communication is not a critical factor."
"CiA DS-102: The full form of CiA is CAN in Automation, which defines the specifications for the CAN connector."
"As far as the implementation is concerned, the CAN controller and CAN transceiver are implemented in the software with the help of the application, operating system, and network management functions."
"SOF: SOF stands for the start of frame, which indicates that the new frame is entered in a network. It is of 1 bit."
"Identifier: A standard data format defined under the CAN 2.0 A specification uses an 11-bit message identifier for arbitration. Basically, this message identifier sets the priority of the data frame."
"RTR: RTR stands for Remote Transmission Request, which defines the frame type, whether it is a data frame or a remote frame. It is of 1-bit."
"Control field: It has user-defined functions.

IDE: An IDE bit in a control field stands for identifier extension. A dominant IDE bit defines the 11-bit standard identifier, whereas recessive IDE bit defines the 29-bit extended identifier.
DLC: DLC stands for Data Length Code, which defines the data length in a data field. It is of 4 bits.
Data field: The data field can contain upto 8 bytes."
"IDE: An IDE bit in a control field stands for identifier extension. A dominant IDE bit defines the 11-bit standard identifier, whereas recessive IDE bit defines the 29-bit extended identifier."
"DLC: DLC stands for Data Length Code, which defines the data length in a data field. It is of 4 bits."
Data field: The data field can contain upto 8 bytes.
"CRC field: The data frame also contains a cyclic redundancy check field of 15 bit, which is used to detect the corruption if it occurs during the transmission time. The sender will compute the CRC before sending the data frame, and the receiver also computes the CRC and then compares the computed CRC with the CRC received from the sender. If the CRC does not match, then the receiver will generate the error."
"ACK field: This is the receiver's acknowledgment. In other protocols, a separate packet for an acknowledgment is sent after receiving all the packets, but in case of CAN protocol, no separate packet is sent for an acknowledgment."
EOF: EOF stands for end of frame. It contains 7 consecutive recessive bits known End of frame.
Now we will see how data is transmitted through the CAN network.
"A CAN network consists of multiple of CAN nodes. In the above case, we have considered three CAN nodes, and named them as node A, node B, and node C. CAN node consists of three elements which are given below:"
"Host
A host is a microcontroller or microprocessor which is running some application to do a specific job. A host decides what the received message means and what message it should send next."
"CAN Controller
CAN controller deals with the communication functions described by the CAN protocol. It also triggers the transmission, or the reception of the CAN messages."
"CAN Transceiver
CAN transceiver is responsible for the transmission or the reception of the data on the CAN bus. It converts the data signal into the stream of data collected from the CAN bus that the CAN controller can understand."
"In the above diagram, unshielded twisted pair cable is used to transmit or receive the data. It is also known as CAN bus, and CAN bus consists of two lines, i.e., CAN low line and CAN high line, which are also known as CANH and CANL, respectively. The transmission occurs due to the differential voltage applied to these lines. The CAN uses twisted pair cable and differential voltage because of its environment. For example, in a car, motor, ignition system, and many other devices can cause data loss and data corruption due to noise. The twisting of the two lines also reduces the magnetic field. The bus is terminated with 120Ω resistance at each end."
"With the help of differential voltage, we will determine how 0 and 1 are transmitted through the CAN bus. The above figure is the voltage graph that shows the voltage level of CAN low and CAN high. In CAN terminology, logic 1 is said to be recessive while logic 0 is dominant. When CAN high line and CAN low line are applied with 2.5 volts, then the actual differential voltage would be zero volt. A zero volt on CAN bus is read by the CAN transceiver as a recessive or logic 1. A zero volt on CAN bus is an ideal state of the bus. When CAN high line is pulled up to 3.5 volt and the CAN low line is pulled down to 1.5 volt, then the bus's actual differential voltage would be 2 volts. It is treated as a dominant bit or logic 0 by the CAN transceiver. If the bus state is reached to dominant or logic 0 then it would become impossible to move to the recessive state by any other node."
"Logic 1 is a recessive state. To transmit 1 on CAN bus, both CAN high and CAN low should be applied with 2.5V."
"Logic 0 is a dominant state. To transmit 0 on CAN bus, CAN high should be applied at 3.5V and CAN low should be applied at 1.5V."
"If the node reaches the dominant state, it cannot move back to the recessive state by any other node."
"From the above scenario, we get to know that the dominant state overwrites the recessive state. When the node sends the dominant and the recessive bit simultaneously, then the bus remains dominant. The recessive level occurs only when all the nodes send the recessive bit. Such logic is known as AND logic, and physically it is implemented as an open collector circuit."
"As we know that the message is sent based on the priority set in the arbitration field. For the standard frame, the message identifier is 11 bit, while for the extended frame, the message identifier is 29 bit. It allows the system designer to design the message identifier at the design itself. The smaller the message identifier, the higher, would be the message priority."
"The sender wants to send the message and waiting for the CAN bus to become idle. If the CAN bus is idle, then the sender sends the SOF or the dominant bit for the bus access. Then, it sends the message identifier bit in the most significant bit. If the node detects the dominant bit on the bus while it has transmitted the recessive bit, it means that the node has lost the arbitration and stops transmitting further bits. The sender will wait and resend the message once the bus is free."
"If we consider three nodes, i.e., Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3, the message identifiers of these nodes are 0x7F3, 0x6B3, and 0x6D9, respectively."
The transmission of all the three nodes with the most significant bit is shown in the above diagram.
"11th bit: As all the three bits of nodes are recessive, so bus bit will also remain recessive."
"10th bit: All the nodes have 10th bit as recessive, so the bus will also remain recessive."
"9th bit: Node 1 has recessive bit while other nodes have a dominant bit, so the bus will also remain dominant. In this case, node 1 has lost the arbitration, so it stops sending bits."
"8th bit: Both node 2 and node 3 are sending recessive bit, so that the bus state will remain recessive."
"7th bit: The node 2 is sending dominant bit while node 3 has sent recessive bit, so that the bus state will remain dominant. In this case, the node 3 has lost the arbitration, so it stops sending the message while the node 2 has won the arbitration means that it will continue to hold the bus until the message is received."
"The HTTP status code determines whether the request made by the client has been successfully completed or not. The server's status codes are provided in response to the client's request to the server. In short, we can say that when the client makes a request, then the HTTP status codes sent by the server allow the clients to know about whether the request was a success, a failure, or something in-between."
"When the browser sends a request to the server, the server responds back with an HTTP status code of three digits long."
The status codes are divided into five classes. The first digit of the HTTP status code defines the class out of these five classes while the last two digits do not have any role of categorization. The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is an organization that contains the official registry of HTTP status codes. The following are the five classed defined by the IANA standard:
"The 100 blocks are informational requests, 200 blocks are success requests, 300 blocks are for redirects, 400 blocks will be for client errors, and 500 blocks will be server errors."
"The codes which are starting with one will give some information while the connection is still in progress. This class of status code defines that the request has been received, and processing has been started. An informational response is issued to inform the client that the request processing has been started and waits for a final response. The response consists of only the status line and the optional header fields. It is terminated by an empty line."
"The 100 continue is an informational status response code that indicates till now everything is OK, and the client should continue sending the request body. If the request is finished, then ignore this status code."
"A client should send the Expect: 100- continue as a header in an initial request so that the server can check the request's header, the client will receive the 100 continue HTTP status code in response before sending the request body."
"The client has requested the server to switch the protocol. The server sends the 100 switching protocol as a response code to inform the client that it is switching to the protocol as requested by the client, which sent the message that includes the upgrade request header. In short, we can say that server responds to the upgrade request header."
"The 102 processing status code is sent by the server to inform the client that it has accepted the complete request and processing the request, but still, no response is available."
"The 2xx class means that the request made by the client was received, understood, and accepted. Or we can say that the 2xx http status code represents that the Http request was successful."
Whenever the server sends back the 200 OK status code in response to the request made by the client is accepted and successful. The actual response with 200 OK might be dependent on the HTTP request method. The following methods can be sent in the HTTP request header:
"Get method: The Get() method is used when we want something from the server. For example, we requested some resources from the server; then, the requested resource would be sent in the response body."
Head method: The head() method is used only when we are requesting the headers. The entity-header fields of the requested resource sent in the response body without any message.
"Post method: If we send the post() method to the server, we are requesting some new resources. An entity describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body."
"When the server sends back the 201 created as the response code, which says that the request made by the client to the server to create a new resource was successful. The server returns the information regarding the location of the newly created resource in the header field. In short, we can say that the 201 Created response is used to provide the URI in the location header field of the newly created resource."
"The server sends 202 accepted in response to inform the client that we have accepted the request and will do the request processing later. This response is used when there is heavy computational processing required or request needs to be processed in the near future. For example, a client sends a request to server for a NEFT where NEFT is used to transfer the money from one account to another account in another bank. NEFT request is processed three times a day, i.e., one in the morning, second in the afternoon, and third in the evening. In such cases, a 202 accepted response is sent that says your request for transfer money is accepted, but I will do it later."
"The server uses another response code, i.e., 203 Non-Authoritative Information, which lets the client know that the proxy server is sitting between the client and the server. The proxy may or may not change the header information."
"The 204 No Content is used when the client's request is successful, but the server has nothing to send in the response body. Instead of simply saying 204, the server says 204 that your request is successful. In this response, the message body is empty."
"Sometimes the client also gets the 205 Reset Content HTTP response, and this response is used in cases when the server wants client viewport to be reset. For example, the client creates a form through which we can create a category, and we submit it, the server sends back the 205 response. This response means that the client needs to reset the input category to blank or to reset the input category for the name of the category that was earlier used."
"The client can also receive the 206 partial content response, and this response means that the server has fulfilled the partial GET request, not the complete one. The client can use the Range Header field that indicates the desired range, so 206 can navigate to a bigger response. The client can also include the If-Range header field to make the request conditional."
"The 207 Multi-Status is a new addition in the response code. For example, the client sends a request to the server; then the server prepares a response. To prepare a response, the server needs to connect with three different machines, i.e., database system, file system, and the cache system. Let's suppose that the database system is down, and it sends 500; in such cases, the server cannot say that it was successful or not successful, so it sends back 207 responses. The multi-status code is included in a response body as a text/xml or application/xml."
"The 208 is similar to 207, but it is used only for WebDAV. WebDAV stands for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning. WebDAV is an extension of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations on the distributed net."
The 3xx block is a class used for redirection. It indicates that the client needs to take some additional measures to complete the request. Here Redirection means URL forwarding is a process of providing more one URL to the page. The HTTP provides HTTP redirect response for such kind of operations.
The permanent redirections are those redirections in which the new URL replaces the existing URL. This means that the original URL is no longer exists and replaced by the new one.
The following are the status codes of the permanent redirections:
"The 301 HTTP status code tells the browser that the uri of the resource has been changed permanently to the new uri specified in the 'Location' response header. If we make a new request in the browser, then subsequently browser will not make another request to the original link."
"In the above example, when the user manually types the url, i.e., www.example.org/index.php, then the browser will make the call to the www.example.org/index.asp as the server responds with a 301 response code having text Moved Permanently and the new location is www.example.org/index.asp."
"The http response status code 301 Moved Permanently is used for permanent URL redirection, which means that the current links are updated. The new URL is provided in the Location field included with a response. The 301 HTTP status code is also used for upgrading the users from HTTP to HTTPS."
"RFC 2616 states that if a 301 status code is received in response to other than GET or HEAD, the client must ask the user before redirecting. In other words, we can say that the 301 response status code does not inform the browsers to automatically redirect the POST method request to the GET method request. But some browsers mistakenly redirect the POST method request to the GET method request."
"The 308 status code came in the HTTP standard in April 2015, as mentioned in the RFC7538 document specification for the 308 status code. The 308 is an HTTP response status code, which is similar to the 301 status code, which means that the requested resource has been replaced by the new uri as specified in the Location header included within the response. The 308 rarely indicates an actual problem, but it mainly occurs due to the changes that occur in the server's behavior or configuration. No other status codes indicate the permanent redirect. The 308 is the only one that indicates the permanent redirect. It also avoids the automatic redirect from the POST method request to the GET method request."
"All modern browsers detect the 308 Permanent Response and perform the redirection automatically. The server sends a 308 HTTP status code that includes the location header as a response where the location header defines the requested resource location. For example, if the client makes the POST request, then the webserver will configure to redirect to the different uri."
The temporary redirection means the requested resource has assigned a new uri temporarily specified in the location header.
The following are the HTTP status codes used for the temporary redirects:
"The 302 Found informs the browser that the uri of the resource has been changed temporarily. When the client makes a request, the browser redirects it to the new location only. The next time when the request comes, then the browser will call the original uri."
"The server sends the 303 response code to the client to get the requested resource at another uri with GET request, that's why the name of this code is see other. The 303 HTTP response code informs the browser to redirect to another page but not to the newly uploaded resources. The response is sent only when the client has made the PUT or POST request. The method that displays the requested page is a GET method."
"The 307 is similar to 302; the only difference is that it tells the browser that the next request should be made with the same verb as the original. For example, the POST request is made to the original link then it should be redirected to the new link by a POST only."
"307 is similar to 302 as both the responses tell the client to temporarily redirect to the different of the requested resource. The only difference between the 307 and 302 is that in 307, the client must use the same request again. For example, if the client issues the POST request as an original request, then the client should follow the same POST request in the next request."
"When the server sends 300 multiple choices, HTTP response indicating that the request has multiple responses. The browser can choose either of them. There is no standard way of choosing among these multiple responses."
"The server generates the 304 Not Modified response only when the file is not changed since it was last accessed. This response basically increases the speed of the user's browsing experience. If the page that the user is accessing is not modified, then the client will show the cached data which is stored locally to the user, so that the client does not make the request to the webserver for the file. The 304 response is sent in response to the client's conditional validation request to indicate that the client's copy is available in a cache."
"When the client makes a Conditional Validation request, then the client sends the Last-Modified date of its copy with the help of If-Modified-Since header and the cached copy's ETag identifier with the help of If-None-match identifier. The server checks these headers to find whether the latest file is available in the cache or not. If it is the latest, then the server sends back the 304 HTTP response. In this case, the client can use the file from the cache instead sending the request to the server for the file. If the server finds an outdated file in a cache, it then sends back the 200 OK response and a new response body."
"The server sends the 4xx HTTP response status codes to the client when some errors occur in the request made by the client. This response indicates that the browser has sent a wrong request with an error that cannot be processed by the server. To get the proper response, the client needs to send the correct request again."
"If the webserver is not able to serve the requested resource because of the wrong syntax, then the server sends back the 400 HTTP invalid request in response."
"When some webpage requires authentication, and the user tries to access the authenticated resource, then the server sends the 401 Unauthorized Request in response. For example, the webpage is authenticated by the user id and password."
The 402 payment required HTTP response indicates that the client is required to make an online payment to process the request. This response status code is not a standard client error and reserved for future use.
"The server sends the 403 Forbidden HTTP response when the client sends the correct request, but the server cannot serve it. The 403 is different from 402 as in 402, the user should be authorized to access the web page, whereas, in 403, there is no role of authentication. For example, 403 is sent when some authorized user tries to access the restricted page."
"The server sends the 404 Not Found error when the requested resource is not available on the server. The reason behind this error could be that the site owner has removed the URL, or the user has mistyped the URL."
"The 405 Method not allowed response code is received when the server knows the request method, but the requested resource does not support it. In this case, the server generates the ALLOW header field that contains all the supported methods by the target resource."
The 406 Not Acceptable Request HTTP response is generated when the client makes a request in a different format. The reason could be the different language or encoding method used in a request.
"The error codes that come under the 5xx range are sent to the client when some problems occur with a server. When the client makes a request for some website, the browser sends a request to the website's server, and if the website's server is not able to serve the request, then the 5xx error code is sent to the client. These errors mainly when the server is facing some problem or unable to perform a request."
"The 5xx error messages represent the server-side error messages in which the website's server is unsuccessful in performing a request. The server-side error does not mean that problem is coming on a website, computer, or an internet connection."
There are various 5xx status codes available so that the specific problem can be identified:
"The 500 internet server error status code occurs when the server cannot determine the problem then stops responding to the request. This error can occur due to the incorrect server's configuration. To correct this error, the website owner needs to check the server's configuration and contact the web hosting company to fix it."
The 501 Not implemented HTTP error response code indicates that the server cannot serve the requested resource as the method mentioned in the request is not supported.
"This error status code also sends the Retry-After header that tells the client when to recheck the functionality. The methods that the server support are GET and HEAD. If the server recognizes the method specified in the request, but it will not support it. In this case, 405 Not Allowed response is sent to the client."
"The 502 Bad Gateway response code means that the proxy server does not get the origin or upstream server's response. If the edge server receives a 502 Bad Gateway from the origin server, then it sends back the 500 Origin Not Reachable response to the client."
"The 503 Service Unavailable response status code is sent when other requests overload the server, or the server is under maintenance. The difference between the 500 and 503 is that in 500, something goes wrong in the server that prevents it from handling the requests, whereas, in 503, the server is working fine and it is also able to serve the request but has opted to send the 503 response."
The websites can use the following ways to represent this error:
"The 504 Gateway timeout error occurs when the server does not get the response from another upstream server required to complete the request. When the webserver tries to load a page but didn't get the response from the second server for the required information, then the webserver uses 504 as a response code."
The 505 HTTP version is not supported response code is sent if the server does not support the HTTP version specified in the request.
507 Insufficient space is an HTTP response status code introduced by the WebDAV specification. It is used to inform the client that the request could not proceed as no space is available on a disk.
"When the client sends a request, then it also sends the extension, which is to be used. If the server does not support the extension specified in the request, then the server sends the 510 as a response code."
"An HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP protocol provides communication between different communication systems. When the user makes an HTTP request on the browser, then the webserver sends the requested data to the user in the form of web pages. In short, we can say that the HTTP protocol allows us to transfer the data from the server to the client."
"An HTTP is an application layer protocol that comes above the TCP layer. It has provided some standard rules to the web browsers and servers, which they can use to communicate with each other."
"An HTTP is a stateless protocol as each transaction is executed separately without having any knowledge of the previous transactions, which means that once the transaction is completed between the web browser and the server, the connection gets lost."
"The full form of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The HTTP protocol does not provide the security of the data, while HTTP ensures the security of the data. Therefore, we can say that HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol. This protocol allows transferring the data in an encrypted form. The use of HTTPS protocol is mainly required where we need to enter the bank account details. The HTTPS protocol is mainly used where we require to enter the login credentials. In modern browsers such as chrome, both the protocols, i.e., HTTP and HTTPS, are marked differently. To provide encryption, HTTPS uses an encryption protocol known as Transport Layer Security, and officially, it is referred to as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol uses a mechanism known as asymmetric public key infrastructure, and it uses two different keys which are given below:"
"Private key: This key is available on the web server, which is managed by the owner of a website."
Public key: This key is available to everyone. It converts the data into an encrypted form.
The major difference between the HTTP and HTTPS is the SSL certificate. The HTTPS protocol is an extended version of the HTTP protocol with an additional feature of security.
This additional feature of security is very important for those websites which transmit sensitive data such as credit card information.
"The HTTPS protocol is secured due to the SSL protocol. The SSL protocol encrypts the data which the client transmits to the server. If someone tries to steal the information which is being communicated between the client and the server, then he/she would not be able to understand due to the encryption. This is the main difference between the HTTP and HTTPS that the HTTP does not contain SSL, whereas the HTTPS contains SSL that provides secure communication between the client and the server."
"Till now, we read that the HTTPS is better than HTTP because it provides security. Sometimes our website does not contain an e-commerce page that requires sensitive data; in that case, we can switch to the HTTP protocol. Despite the security, HTTPS also provides SEO. So, we do need to put more effort into boosting our SEO."
"The speed of HTTP is faster than the HTTPS as the HTTPS contains SSL protocol, while HTTPS does not contain an SSL protocol. This additional feature of SSL in HTTPS makes the page loading slower."
The following are the differences between the HTTP and HTTPS:
"The HTTP protocol stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, whereas the HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure."
"The HTTP protocol is not secure protocol as it does not contain SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which means that the data can be stolen when the data is transmitted from the client to the server. Whereas, the HTTPS protocol contains the SSL certificate that converts the data into an encrypted form, so no data can be stolen in this case as outsiders do not understand the encrypted text."
"The HTTP transmits the data over port number 80, whereas the HTTPS transmits the data over 443 port number. Under the documentation issued by Tim Berners-Lee, he stated that ""if the port number is not specified, then it will be considered as HTTP""."
"When RFC 1340 was announced, then the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) provided port number 80 to the HTTP. When the new RFC was released in the year 1994, the HTTPS is assigned with a port number 443."
"The HTTP protocol works on the application layer while the HTTPS protocol works on the transport layer. As we know that the responsibility of the transport layer is to move the data from the client to the server, and data security is a major concern. HTTPS operates in the transport layer, so it is wrapped with a security layer."
"When we want our websites to have an HTTPS protocol, then we need to install the signed SSL certificate. The SSL certificates can be available for both free and paid service. The service can be chosen based on business needs."
"The HTTP does not contain any SSL certificates, so it does not decrypt the data, and the data is sent in the form of plain text."
The SEO advantages are provided to those websites that use HTTPS as GOOGLE gives the preferences to those websites that use HTTPS rather than the websites that use HTTP.
"If we are running an online business, then it becomes necessary to have HTTPS. If we do not use the HTTPS in an online business, then the customers would not purchase as they are scared that their data can be stolen by the outsiders."
"RIP stands for Routing Information Protocol. RIP is an intra-domain routing protocol used within an autonomous system. Here, intra-domain means routing the packets in a defined domain, for example, web browsing within an institutional area. To understand the RIP protocol, our main focus is to know the structure of the packet, how many fields it contains, and how these fields determine the routing table."
"Before understanding the structure of the packet, we first look at the following points:"
"RIP is based on the distance vector-based strategy, so we consider the entire structure as a graph where nodes are the routers, and the links are the networks."
"In a routing table, the first column is the destination, or we can say that it is a network address."
The cost metric is the number of hops to reach the destination. The number of hops available in a network would be the cost. The hop count is the number of networks required to reach the destination.
"In RIP, infinity is defined as 16, which means that the RIP is useful for smaller networks or small autonomous systems. The maximum number of hops that RIP can contain is 15 hops, i.e., it should not have more than 15 hops as 16 is infinity."
The next column contains the address of the router to which the packet is to be sent to reach the destination.
"When the router sends the packet to the network segment, then it is counted as a single hop."
"In the above figure, when the router 1 forwards the packet to the router 2 then it will count as 1 hop count. Similarly, when the router 2 forwards the packet to the router 3 then it will count as 2 hop count, and when the router 3 forwards the packet to router 4, it will count as 3 hop count. In the same way, RIP can support maximum upto 15 hops, which means that the 16 routers can be configured in a RIP."
"Now, we look at the structure of the RIP message format. The message format is used to share information among different routers. The RIP contains the following fields in a message:"
"Command: It is an 8-bit field that is used for request or reply. The value of the request is 1, and the value of the reply is 2."
"Version: Here, version means that which version of the protocol we are using. Suppose we are using the protocol of version1, then we put the 1 in this field."
"Reserved: This is a reserved field, so it is filled with zeroes."
"Family: It is a 16-bit field. As we are using the TCP/IP family, so we put 2 value in this field."
"Network Address: It is defined as 14 bytes field. If we use the IPv4 version, then we use 4 bytes, and the other 10 bytes are all zeroes."
"Distance: The distance field specifies the hop count, i.e., the number of hops used to reach the destination."
"If there are 8 routers in a network where Router 1 wants to send the data to Router 3. If the network is configured with RIP, it will choose the route which has the least number of hops. There are three routes in the above network, i.e., Route 1, Route 2, and Route 3. The Route 2 contains the least number of hops, i.e., 2 where Route 1 contains 3 hops, and Route 3 contains 4 hops, so RIP will choose Route 2."
"Suppose R1 wants to send the data to R4. There are two possible routes to send data from r1 to r2. As both the routes contain the same number of hops, i.e., 3, so RIP will send the data to both the routes simultaneously. This way, it manages the load balancing, and data reach the destination a bit faster."
"In RIP, the route is chosen based on the hop count metric. If another route of better bandwidth is available, then that route would not be chosen. Let's understand this scenario through an example."
"We can observe that Route 2 is chosen in the above figure as it has the least hop count. The Route 1 is free and data can be reached more faster; instead of this, data is sent to the Route 2 that makes the Route 2 slower due to the heavy traffic. This is one of the biggest disadvantages of RIP."
"The RIP is a classful routing protocol, so it does not support the VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask). The classful routing protocol is a protocol that does not include the subnet mask information in the routing updates."
"It broadcasts the routing updates to the entire network that creates a lot of traffic. In RIP, the routing table updates every 30 seconds. Whenever the updates occur, it sends the copy of the update to all the neighbors except the one that has caused the update. The sending of updates to all the neighbors creates a lot of traffic. This rule is known as a split-horizon rule."
"It faces a problem of Slow convergence. Whenever the router or link fails, then it often takes minutes to stabilize or take an alternative route; This problem is known as Slow convergence."
RIP supports maximum 15 hops which means that the maximum 16 hops can be configured in a RIP
"The Administrative distance value is 120 (Ad value). If the Ad value is less, then the protocol is more reliable than the protocol with more Ad value."
"The RIP protocol has the highest Ad value, so it is not as reliable as the other routing protocols."
The following timers are used to update the routing table:
The routers configured with RIP send their updates to all the neighboring routers every 30 seconds.
"The RIP invalid timer is 180 seconds, which means that if the router is disconnected from the network or some link goes down, then the neighbor router will wait for 180 seconds to take the update. If it does not receive the update within 180 seconds, then it will mark the particular route as not reachable."
The RIP flush timer is 240 second which is almost equal to 4 min means that if the router does not receive the update within 240 seconds then the neighbor route will remove that particular route from the routing table which is a very slow process as 4 minutes is a long time to wait.
"In computer networking, the UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. The David P. Reed developed the UDP protocol in 1980. It is defined in RFC 768, and it is a part of the TCP/IP protocol, so it is a standard protocol over the internet. The UDP protocol allows the computer applications to send the messages in the form of datagrams from one machine to another machine over the Internet Protocol (IP) network. The UDP is an alternative communication protocol to the TCP protocol (transmission control protocol). Like TCP, UDP provides a set of rules that governs how the data should be exchanged over the internet. The UDP works by encapsulating the data into the packet and providing its own header information to the packet. Then, this UDP packet is encapsulated to the IP packet and sent off to its destination. Both the TCP and UDP protocols send the data over the internet protocol network, so it is also known as TCP/IP and UDP/IP. There are many differences between these two protocols. UDP enables the process to process communication, whereas the TCP provides host to host communication. Since UDP sends the messages in the form of datagrams, it is considered the best-effort mode of communication. TCP sends the individual packets, so it is a reliable transport medium. Another difference is that the TCP is a connection-oriented protocol whereas, the UDP is a connectionless protocol as it does not require any virtual circuit to transfer the data."
UDP also provides a different port number to distinguish different user requests and also provides the checksum capability to verify whether the complete data has arrived or not; the IP layer does not provide these two services.
"UDP is the simplest transport layer communication protocol. It contains a minimum amount of communication mechanisms. It is considered an unreliable protocol, and it is based on best-effort delivery services. UDP provides no acknowledgment mechanism, which means that the receiver does not send the acknowledgment for the received packet, and the sender also does not wait for the acknowledgment for the packet that it has sent."
"The UDP is a connectionless protocol as it does not create a virtual path to transfer the data. It does not use the virtual path, so packets are sent in different paths between the sender and the receiver, which leads to the loss of packets or received out of order."
"In the case of UDP, the datagrams are sent in some order will be received in the same order is not guaranteed as the datagrams are not numbered."
The UDP protocol uses different port numbers so that the data can be sent to the correct destination. The port numbers are defined between 0 and 1023.
"UDP enables faster transmission as it is a connectionless protocol, i.e., no virtual path is required to transfer the data. But there is a chance that the individual packet is lost, which affects the transmission quality. On the other hand, if the packet is lost in TCP connection, that packet will be resent, so it guarantees the delivery of the data packets."
"The UDP does have any acknowledgment mechanism, i.e., there is no handshaking between the UDP sender and UDP receiver. If the message is sent in TCP, then the receiver acknowledges that I am ready, then the sender sends the data. In the case of TCP, the handshaking occurs between the sender and the receiver, whereas in UDP, there is no handshaking between the sender and the receiver."
Each UDP segment is handled individually of others as each segment takes different path to reach the destination. The UDP segments can be lost or delivered out of order to reach the destination as there is no connection setup between the sender and the receiver.
It is a stateless protocol that means that the sender does not get the acknowledgement for the packet which has been sent.
"As we know that the UDP is an unreliable protocol, but we still require a UDP protocol in some cases. The UDP is deployed where the packets require a large amount of bandwidth along with the actual data. For example, in video streaming, acknowledging thousands of packets is troublesome and wastes a lot of bandwidth. In the case of video streaming, the loss of some packets couldn't create a problem, and it can also be ignored."
"In UDP, the header size is 8 bytes, and the packet size is upto 65,535 bytes. But this packet size is not possible as the data needs to be encapsulated in the IP datagram, and an IP packet, the header size can be 20 bytes; therefore, the maximum of UDP would be 65,535 minus 20. The size of the data that the UDP packet can carry would be 65,535 minus 28 as 8 bytes for the header of the UDP packet and 20 bytes for IP header."
Source port number: It is 16-bit information that identifies which port is going t send the packet.
Destination port number: It identifies which port is going to accept the information. It is 16-bit information which is used to identify application-level service on the destination machine.
Length: It is 16-bit field that specifies the entire length of the UDP packet that includes the header also. The minimum value would be 8-byte as the size of the header is 8 bytes.
"Checksum: It is a 16-bits field, and it is an optional field. This checksum field checks whether the information is accurate or not as there is the possibility that the information can be corrupted while transmission. It is an optional field, which means that it depends upon the application, whether it wants to write the checksum or not. If it does not want to write the checksum, then all the 16 bits are zero; otherwise, it writes the checksum. In UDP, the checksum field is applied to the entire packet, i.e., header as well as data part whereas, in IP, the checksum field is applied to only the header field."
"In UDP protocol, numbers are used to distinguish the different processes on a server and client. We know that UDP provides a process to process communication. The client generates the processes that need services while the server generates the processes that provide services. The queues are available for both the processes, i.e., two queues for each process. The first queue is the incoming queue that receives the messages, and the second one is the outgoing queue that sends the messages. The queue functions when the process is running. If the process is terminated then the queue will also get destroyed."
UDP handles the sending and receiving of the UDP packets with the help of the following components:
Input queue: The UDP packets uses a set of queues for each process.
"Input module: This module takes the user datagram from the IP, and then it finds the information from the control block table of the same port. If it finds the entry in the control block table with the same port as the user datagram, it enqueues the data."
Control Block Table: The control block table contains the entry of open ports.
Output module: The output module creates and sends the user datagram.
Several processes want to use the services of UDP. The UDP multiplexes and demultiplexes the processes so that the multiple processes can run on a single host.
It provides an unreliable connection delivery service. It does not provide any services of IP except that it provides process-to-process communication.
"The UDP message can be lost, delayed, duplicated, or can be out of order."
"It does not provide a reliable transport delivery service. It does not provide any acknowledgment or flow control mechanism. However, it does provide error control to some extent."
"The ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a network layer protocol. It is used for error handling in the network layer, and it is primarily used on network devices such as routers. As different types of errors can exist in the network layer, so ICMP can be used to report these errors and to debug those errors."
"For example, some sender wants to send the message to some destination, but the router couldn't send the message to the destination. In this case, the router sends the message to the sender that I could not send the message to that destination."
"The IP protocol does not have any error-reporting or error-correcting mechanism, so it uses a message to convey the information. For example, if someone sends the message to the destination, the message is somehow stolen between the sender and the destination. If no one reports the error, then the sender might think that the message has reached the destination. If someone in-between reports the error, then the sender will resend the message very quickly."
"The ICMP resides in the IP layer, as shown in the below diagram."
The error-reporting message means that the router encounters a problem when it processes an IP packet then it reports a message.
"The query messages are those messages that help the host to get the specific information of another host. For example, suppose there are a client and a server, and the client wants to know whether the server is live or not, then it sends the ICMP message to the server."
"The message format has two things; one is a category that tells us which type of message it is. If the message is of error type, the error message contains the type and the code. The type defines the type of message while the code defines the subtype of the message."
"Type: It is an 8-bit field. It defines the ICMP message type. The values range from 0 to 127 are defined for ICMPv6, and the values from 128 to 255 are the informational messages."
Code: It is an 8-bit field that defines the subtype of the ICMP message
Checksum: It is a 16-bit field to detect whether the error exists in the message or not.
The error reporting messages are broadly classified into the following categories:
"The destination unreachable error occurs when the packet does not reach the destination. Suppose the sender sends the message, but the message does not reach the destination, then the intermediate router reports to the sender that the destination is unreachable."
The above diagram shows the message format of the destination unreachable message. In the message format:
Type: It defines the type of message. The number 3 specifies that the destination is unreachable.
Code (0 to 15): It is a 4-bit number which identifies whether the message comes from some intermediate router or the destination itself.
"Sometimes the destination does not want to process the request, so it sends the destination unreachable message to the source. A router does not detect all the problems that prevent the delivery of a packet."
"There is no flow control or congestion control mechanism in the network layer or the IP protocol. The sender is concerned with only sending the packets, and the sender does not think whether the receiver is ready to receive those packets or is there any congestion occurs in the network layer so that the sender can send a lesser number of packets, so there is no flow control or congestion control mechanism. In this case, ICMP provides feedback, i.e., source quench. Suppose the sender resends the packet at a higher rate, and the router is not able to handle the high data rate. To overcome such a situation, the router sends a source quench message to tell the sender to send the packet at a lower rate."
"The above diagram shows the message format of the source quench message. It is a type 4 message, and code is zero."
"So, the sender must either stop or slow down the sending of datagrams until the congestion is reduced. The router sends one source-quench message for each datagram that is discarded due to the congestion in the network layer."
"Sometimes the situation arises when there are many routers that exist between the sender and the receiver. When the sender sends the packet, then it moves in a routing loop. The time exceeded is based on the time-to-live value. When the packet traverses through the router, then each router decreases the value of TTL by one. Whenever a router decreases a datagram with a time-to-live value to zero, then the router discards a datagram and sends the time exceeded message to the original source."
"Each of the MAC layers has different data units. For example, some layers can handle upto 1500 data units, and some can handle upto 300 units. When the packet is sent from a layer having 1500 units to the layer having 300 units, then the packet is divided into fragments; this process is known as fragmentation. These 1500 units are divided into 5 fragments, i.e., f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, and these fragments reach the destination in a sequence. If all the fragments are not reached to the destination in a set time, they discard all the received fragments and send a time-exceeded message to the original source."
"In the case of fragmentation, the code will be different as compared to TTL. Let's observe the message format of time exceeded."
"The above message format shows that the type of time-exceeded is 11, and the code can be either 0 or 1. The code 0 represents TTL, while code 1 represents fragmentation. In a time-exceeded message, the code 0 is used by the routers to show that the time-to-live value is reached to zero."
The code 1 is used by the destination to show that all the fragments do not reach within a set time.
The router and the destination host can send a parameter problem message. This message conveys that some parameters are not properly set.
"The above diagram shows the message format of the parameter problem. The type of message is 12, and the code can be 0 or 1."
"When the packet is sent, then the routing table is gradually augmented and updated. The tool used to achieve this is the redirection message. For example, A wants to send the packet to B, and there are two routers exist between A and B. First, A sends the data to the router 1. The router 1 sends the IP packet to router 2 and redirection message to A so that A can update its routing table."
The ICMP Query message is used for error handling or debugging the internet. This message is commonly used to ping a message.
"A router or a host can send an echo-request message. It is used to ping a message to another host that ""Are you alive"". If the other host is alive, then it sends the echo-reply message. An echo-reply message is sent by the router or the host that receives an echo-request message."
"The echo-request message and echo-reply message can be used by the network managers to check the operation of the IP protocol. Suppose two hosts, i.e., A and B, exist, and A wants to communicate with host B. The A host can communicate to host B if the link is not broken between A and B, and B is still alive."
"The echo-request message and echo-reply message check the host's reachability, and it can be done by invoking the ping command."
"The above diagram shows the message format of the echo-request and echo-reply message. The type of echo-request is 8, and the request of echo-reply is 0. The code of this message is 0."
"The timestamp-request and timestamp-reply messages are also a type of query messages. Suppose the computer A wants to know the time on computer B, so it sends the timestamp-request message to computer B. The computer B responds with a timestamp-reply message."
"The type of timestamp-request is 13, and the type of timestamp-reply is 14. The code of this type of message is 0."
"It can be used to calculate the round-trip time between the source and the destination, even if the clocks are not synchronized."
It can also be used to synchronize the clocks in two different machines if the exact transit time is known.
"If the sender knows the exact transit time, then it can synchronize the clock. The sender asks the time on the receiver's clock, and then it adds the time and propagation delay. Suppose the time is 1:00 clock and propagation delay is 100 ms, then time would be 1:00 clock plus 100 ms."
"There are several tools used for debugging. In this topic, we will learn two tools that use ICMP for debugging. The two tools are ping and traceroute. We have learned about ping in echo-request and echo-reply messages that check whether the host or a router is alive or running."
"Traceroute is a tool that tracks the route taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination. It records the time taken by the packet on each hop during its route from source to destination. Traceroute uses ICMP messages and TTL values. The TTL value is calculated; if the TTL value reaches zero, the packet gets discarded. Traceroute uses small TTL values as they get quickly expired. If the TTL value is 1 then the message is produced by router 1; if the TTL value is 2 then the message is produced by router 2, and so on."
"Suppose A and B are two different hosts, and A wants to send the packet to the host B. Between A and B, 3 routers exist. To determine the location of the routers, we use the traceroute tool."
"TTL value =1: First, host A sends the packet to router 1 with TTL value 1, and when the packet reaches to router 1 then router reduces the value of TTL by one and TTL values becomes 0. In this case, router 1 generates the time-exceeded message and host A gets to know that router 1 is the first router in a path."
"TTL value=2: When host A sends the packet to router 1 with TTL value 2, and when the packet reaches to router 1 then the TTL value gets decremented by 1 and the TTL value becomes 1. Then router 1 sends the packet to router 2, and the TTL value becomes 0, so the router generates a time-exceeded message. The host A gets to know that router 2 is the second router on the path."
"TTL value=3: When host A sends the packet to router 1 with TTL value 3, then the router decrements its value by one, and the TTL value becomes 2. Then, router 1 sends the packet to router 2, and the TTL value becomes 1. Then, router 2 sends the packet to router 3, and the TTL value becomes 0. As TTL value becomes 0, router 3 generates a time-exceeded message. In this way, host A is the third router on a path."
"MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. MQTT is a machine to machine internet of things connectivity protocol. It is an extremely lightweight and publish-subscribe messaging transport protocol. This protocol is useful for the connection with the remote location where the bandwidth is a premium. These characteristics make it useful in various situations, including constant environment such as for communication machine to machine and internet of things contexts. It is a publish and subscribe system where we can publish and receive the messages as a client. It makes it easy for communication between multiple devices. It is a simple messaging protocol designed for the constrained devices and with low bandwidth, so it's a perfect solution for the internet of things applications."
The MQTT has some unique features which are hardly found in other protocols. Some of the features of an MQTT are given below:
"It is a machine to machine protocol, i.e., it provides communication between the devices."
It is designed as a simple and lightweight messaging protocol that uses a publish/subscribe system to exchange the information between the client and the server.
It does not require that both the client and the server establish a connection at the same time.
"It provides faster data transmission, like how WhatsApp/messenger provides a faster delivery. It's a real-time messaging protocol."
It allows the clients to subscribe to the narrow selection of topics so that they can receive the information they are looking for.
"The MQTT was developed by Dr. Andy Stanford-Clark, IBM, and Arlen Nipper. The previous versions of protocol 3.1 and 3.1.1 were made available under MQTT ORG. In 2014, the MQTT was officially published by OASIS. The OASIS becomes a new home for the development of the MQTT. Then, the OASIS started the further development of the MQTT. Version 3.1.1 is backward comfortable with a 3.1 and brought only minor changes such as changes to the connect message and clarification of the 3.1 version. The recent version of MQTT is 5.0, which is a successor of the 3.1.1 version. Version 5.0 is not backward, comfortable like version 3.1.1. According to the specifications, version 5.0 has a significant number of features that make the code in place."
Enhancement in the scalability and the large-scale system in order to set up with the thousands or the millions of devices.
"To understand the MQTT architecture, we first look at the components of the MQTT."
"The message is the data that is carried out by the protocol across the network for the application. When the message is transmitted over the network, then the message contains the following parameters:"
"In MQTT, the subscriber and publisher are the two roles of a client. The clients subscribe to the topics to publish and receive messages. In simple words, we can say that if any program or device uses an MQTT, then that device is referred to as a client. A device is a client if it opens the network connection to the server, publishes messages that other clients want to see, subscribes to the messages that it is interested in receiving, unsubscribes to the messages that it is not interested in receiving, and closes the network connection to the server."
"Publish: When the client sends the data to the server, then we call this operation as a publish."
"Subscribe: When the client receives the data from the server, then we call this operation a subscription."
"The device or a program that allows the client to publish the messages and subscribe to the messages. A server accepts the network connection from the client, accepts the messages from the client, processes the subscribe and unsubscribe requests, forwards the application messages to the client, and closes the network connection from the client."
The label provided to the message is checked against the subscription known by the server is known as TOPIC.
"Now we will look at the architecture of MQTT. To understand it more clearly, we will look at the example. Suppose a device has a temperature sensor and wants to send the rating to the server or the broker. If the phone or desktop application wishes to receive this temperature value on the other side, then there will be two things that happened. The publisher first defines the topic; for example, the temperature then publishes the message, i.e., the temperature's value. After publishing the message, the phone or the desktop application on the other side will subscribe to the topic, i.e., temperature and then receive the published message, i.e., the value of the temperature. The server or the broker's role is to deliver the published message to the phone or the desktop application."
"The MQTT uses the command and the command acknowledgment format, which means that each command has an associated acknowledgment. As shown in the above figure that the connect command has connect acknowledgment, subscribe command has subscribe acknowledgment, and publish command has publish acknowledgment. This mechanism is similar to the handshaking mechanism as in TCP protocol."
Now we will look at the packet structure or message format of the MQTT.
"The MQTT message format consists of 2 bytes fixed header, which is present in all the MQTT packets. The second field is a variable header, which is not always present. The third field is a payload, which is also not always present. The payload field basically contains the data which is being sent. We might think that the payload is a compulsory field, but it does not happen. Some commands do not use the payload field, for example, disconnect message."
As we can observe in the above format that the fixed header contains two bytes. The first byte contains the following fields:
"MQTT Control Packet Type: It occupies 4 bits, i.e., 7 to 4-bit positions. This 4-bit is an assigned value, and each bit represents the MQTT control packet type."
Flag specific to each MQTT packet type: The remaining 4-bits represent flag specific to each MQTT packet type.
"The byte 2 contains the remaining length, which is a variable-length byte integer. It represents the number of bytes remaining in a current control packet, including data in the variable header and payload. Therefore, we can say that the remaining length is equal to the sum of the data in the variable header and the payload."
"The above table shows the control packet types with 4-bit value and direction flow. As we can observe that every command is followed by acknowledgment like CONNECT has CONNACK, PUBLISH has PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL, and PUBCOMP, SUBSCRIBE has SUBACK, UNSUBSCRIBE has UNSUBACK."
"The above table shows the flag value associated with each command. Here, reserved refers to future use, which means that it is not being used right now. In the case of PUBLISH command, flag bits are further divided into DUP, QoS, and RETAIN, where DUP is a duplicate delivery of a PUBLISH packet, QoS is Quality of Service, and RETAIN is retained message flag."
"The remaining length is a variable-length integer that denotes the number of bytes remaining within the current control packet, including data in the variable header and the payload. Therefore, the remaining length is equal to the data in the variable header plus payload."
Remaining length = length of variable header + length of payload
"For example, if the length of the variable header is 20 and the length of the payload is 30, then the remaining length is 50."
"The remaining length can be used upto 4 bytes, and it starts from 2 bytes and can be used upto 4 bytes."
"This field uses 7-bit for the lengths, and MSB bit can be used to continue a flag. If the continuation flag is 1, the next byte is also a part of the remaining length. If the continuation flag is 0, a byte is the last one of the remaining length.
Variable header
Some types of MQTT control packet types contain an optional field also, i.e., variable header component. This field resides between the fixed header and the payload. The content of the variable header depends upon the packet type. The variable header contains the packet identifier field, which is common in several packet types. The variable header component of many MQTT control packet types includes 2-byte integer, i.e., the packet identifier field.
The given list below contains the packet identifier field:

PUBLISH
PUBACK
PUBREC
PUBREL
PUBCOMP
SUBSCRIBE
SUBACK
UNSUBSCRIBE
UNSUBACK

Key points related to the packet identifier field:

A PUBLISH packet should not contain the packet identifier field if the value of QoS (Quality of Service) is set to zero. It implies that if the value of QoS is greater than zero, only the PUBLISH packet will contain the packet identifier field.
When a client sends a new SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, or PUBLISH MQTT control packet, it should assign a non-zero packet identifier that is currently unused.
When a server sends a new PUBLISH MQTT control packet, it should assign a non-zero packet identifier that is currently unused.
A PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBUREL, PUBREC are the acknowledgment packets of PUBLISH command that contain the same packet identifier as the PUBLISH packet.
A SUBACK and UNSUBACK are the acknowledgment packets of SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE, respectively. Both the packets, i.e., SUBACK and UNSUBACK, use the same packet identifier as the SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE packets.
The packet identifier can be reusable after processing the corresponding acknowledgment packet. It can be defined as follows:

If the value of QoS is 1 then the acknowledgment packet of PUBLISH would be PUBACK. If it processes the PUBACK, then the packet identifier of PUBACK can be reused.
If the QoS value is 2 then the acknowledgment packet of PUBLISH would be either PUBCOMP or PUBREC.
Payload
In the ICMP message format, the last MQTT control packet is the payload. This field contains the data which is to be sent. For example, in the case of the CONNECT packet, the payload is a client ID, the username and password, and the PUBLISH packet, the payload is just an application message.

"The OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First. It is a widely used and supported routing protocol. It is an intradomain protocol, which means that it is used within an area or a network. It is an interior gateway protocol that has been designed within a single autonomous system. It is based on a link-state routing algorithm in which each router contains the information of every domain, and based on this information, it determines the shortest path. The goal of routing is to learn routes. The OSPF achieves by learning about every router and subnet within the entire network. Every router contains the same information about the network. The way the router learns this information by sending LSA (Link State Advertisements). These LSAs contain information about every router, subnet, and other networking information. Once the LSAs have been flooded, the OSPF stores the information in a link-state database known as LSDB. The main goal is to have the same information about every router in an LSDBs."
"OSPF divides the autonomous systems into areas where the area is a collection of networks, hosts, and routers. Like internet service providers divide the internet into a different autonomous system for easy management and OSPF further divides the autonomous systems into Areas."
Routers that exist inside the area flood the area with routing information
"In Area, the special router also exists. The special routers are those that are present at the border of an area, and these special routers are known as Area Border Routers. This router summarizes the information about an area and shares the information with other areas."
"All the areas inside an autonomous system are connected to the backbone routers, and these backbone routers are part of a primary area. The role of a primary area is to provide communication between different areas."
There are three steps that can explain the working of OSPF:
Step 1: The first step is to become OSPF neighbors. The two connecting routers running OSPF on the same link creates a neighbor relationship.
"Step 2: The second step is to exchange database information. After becoming the neighbors, the two routers exchange the LSDB information with each other."
"Step 3: The third step is to choose the best route. Once the LSDB information has been exchanged with each other, the router chooses the best route to be added to a routing table based on the calculation of SPF."
The first thing is happened before the relationship is formed is that each router chooses the router ID.
"Router ID (RID): The router ID is a number that uniquely identifies each router on a network. The router ID is in the format of the IPv4 address. There are few ways to set the router ID, the first way is to set the router ID manually and the other way is to let the router decides itself."
The following is the logic that the router chooses to set the router ID:
"Manually assigned: The router checks whether the router ID is manually set or not. If it manually set, then it is a router ID. If it is not manually set, then it will choose the highest 'up' status loopback interface IP address. If there are no loopback interfaces, then it will choose the highest 'up' status non-loopback interface IP address."
"Two routers connected to each other through point to point or multiple routers are connected can communicate with each other through an OSPF protocol. The two routers are adjacent only when both the routers send the HELLO packet to each other. When both the routers receive the acknowledgment of the HELLO packet, then they come in a two-way state. As OSPF is a link state routing protocol, so it allows to create the neighbor relationship between the routers. The two routers can be neighbors only when they belong to the same subnet, share the same area id, subnet mask, timers, and authentication. The OSPF relationship is a relationship formed between the routers so that they can know each other. The two routers can be neighbors if atleast one of them is designated router or backup designated router in a network, or connected through a point-to-point link."
"A link is basically a connection, so the connection between two routers is known as a link."
Point-to-point link: The point-to-point link directly connects the two routers without any host or router in between.
"Transient link: When several routers are attached in a network, they are known as a transient link.
The transient link has two different implementations:
Unrealistic topology: When all the routers are connected to each other, it is known as an unrealistic topology.
Realistic topology: When some designated router exists in a network then it is known as a realistic topology. Here designated router is a router to which all the routers are connected. All the packets sent by the routers will be passed through the designated router."
Stub link: It is a network that is connected to the single router. Data enters to the network through the single router and leaves the network through the same router.
"Virtual link: If the link between the two routers is broken, the administration creates the virtual path between the routers, and that path could be a long one also."
The following are the fields in an OSPF message format:
Version: It is an 8-bit field that specifies the OSPF protocol version.
Type: It is an 8-bit field. It specifies the type of the OSPF packet.
"Message: It is a 16-bit field that defines the total length of the message, including the header. Therefore, the total length is equal to the sum of the length of the message and header."
Source IP address: It defines the address from which the packets are sent. It is a sending routing IP address.
Area identification: It defines the area within which the routing takes place.
Checksum: It is used for error correction and error detection.
"Authentication type: There are two types of authentication, i.e., 0 and 1. Here, 0 means for none that specifies no authentication is available and 1 means for pwd that specifies the password-based authentication."
Authentication: It is a 32-bit field that contains the actual value of the authentication data.
"The Hello packet is used to create a neighborhood relationship and check the neighbor's reachability. Therefore, the Hello packet is used when the connection between the routers need to be established."
"After establishing a connection, if the neighbor router is communicating with the system first time, it sends the database information about the network topology to the system so that the system can update or modify accordingly."
"The link-state request is sent by the router to obtain the information of a specified route. Suppose there are two routers, i.e., router 1 and router 2, and router 1 wants to know the information about the router 2, so router 1 sends the link state request to the router 2. When router 2 receives the link state request, then it sends the link-state information to router 1."
"The link-state update is used by the router to advertise the state of its links. If any router wants to broadcast the state of its links, it uses the link-state update."
"The link-state acknowledgment makes the routing more reliable by forcing each router to send the acknowledgment on each link state update. For example, router A sends the link state update to the router B and router C, then in return, the router B and C sends the link- state acknowledgment to the router A, so that the router A gets to know that both the routers have received the link-state update."
The device running the OSPF protocol undergoes the following states:
"Down: If the device is in a down state, it has not received the HELLO packet. Here, down does not mean that the device is physically down; it means that the OSPF process has not been started yet."
"Init: If the device comes in an init state, it means that the device has received the HELLO packet from the other router."
"2WAY: If the device is in a 2WAY state, which means that both the routers have received the HELLO packet from the other router, and the connection gets established between the routers."
"Exstart: Once the exchange between the routers get started, both the routers move to the Exstart state. In this state, master and slave are selected based on the router's id. The master controls the sequence of numbers, and starts the exchange process."
"Exchange: In the exchange state, both the routers send a list of LSAs to each other that contain a database description."
"Loading: On the loading state, the LSR, LSU, and LSA are exchanged."
"Full: Once the exchange of the LSAs is completed, the routers move to the full state."
"Before going to the Extract state, OSPF chooses one router as a Designated router and another router as a backup designated router. These routers are not the type, but they are the attributes of a router. In the case of broadcast networks, the router selects one router as a designated router and another router as a backup designated router. The election of designated and the backup designated router is done to avoid the flooding in a network and to minimize the number of adjacencies. They serve as a central point for exchanging the routing information among all the routers. Since point-to-point links are directly connected, so DR and BDR are not elected."
"If DR and BDR are not elected, the router will send the update to all the adjacent neighbors, leading to the flooding in a network. To avoid this problem, DR and BDR are elected. Each non-DR and non-BDR send the update only to the DR and BDR instead of exchanging it with other routers in a network segment. DR then distributes the network topology information to other routers in the same area whereas the BDR serves a substitute for the DR. The BDR also receives the routing information from all the router but it does not distribute the information. It distributes the information only when the DR fails."
The multicast address 224.0.0.6 is used by the non-DR and non-BDR to send the routing information to the DR and BDR. The DR and BDR send the routing information to the multicast address 224.0.0.5.
"Based on the following rules, the DR and BDR are elected:"
"The router with the highest OSPF priority is chosen as the DR. By default, the highest priority is set as 1."
"If there is no highest priority, then the router with the highest router Id is chosen as the DR, and the router with the second-highest priority is chosen as the BDR."
"In the above figure, R1 is chosen as the DR, while R2 is chosen as the BDR as R1 has the highest router ID, whereas the R2 has the second-highest router ID. If the link fails between R4 and the system, then R4 updates only R1 and R4 about its link failure. Then, DR updates all the non-DR and non-BDR about the change, and in this case, except R4, only R3 is available as a non-DR and non-BDR."
"Before understanding the stop and Wait protocol, we first know about the error control mechanism. The error control mechanism is used so that the received data should be exactly same whatever sender has sent the data. The error control mechanism is divided into two categories, i.e., Stop and Wait ARQ and sliding window. The sliding window is further divided into two categories, i.e., Go Back N, and Selective Repeat. Based on the usage, the people select the error control mechanism whether it is stop and wait or sliding window."
"Here stop and wait means, whatever the data that sender wants to send, he sends the data to the receiver. After sending the data, he stops and waits until he receives the acknowledgment from the receiver. The stop and wait protocol is a flow control protocol where flow control is one of the services of the data link layer."
It is a data-link layer protocol which is used for transmitting the data over the noiseless channels. It provides unidirectional data transmission which means that either sending or receiving of data will take place at a time. It provides flow-control mechanism but does not provide any error control mechanism.
The idea behind the usage of this frame is that when the sender sends the frame then he waits for the acknowledgment before sending the next frame.
Rule 1: Sender sends one data packet at a time.
Rule 2: Sender sends the next packet only when it receives the acknowledgment of the previous packet.
"Therefore, the idea of stop and wait protocol in the sender's side is very simple, i.e., send one packet at a time, and do not send another packet before receiving the acknowledgment."
"Rule 2: When the data packet is consumed, receiver sends the acknowledgment to the sender."
"Therefore, the idea of stop and wait protocol in the receiver's side is also very simple, i.e., consume the packet, and once the packet is consumed, the acknowledgment is sent. This is known as a flow control mechanism."
"The above figure shows the working of the stop and wait protocol. If there is a sender and receiver, then sender sends the packet and that packet is known as a data packet. The sender will not send the second packet without receiving the acknowledgment of the first packet. The receiver sends the acknowledgment for the data packet that it has received. Once the acknowledgment is received, the sender sends the next packet. This process continues until all the packet are not sent. The main advantage of this protocol is its simplicity but it has some disadvantages also. For example, if there are 1000 data packets to be sent, then all the 1000 packets cannot be sent at a time as in Stop and Wait protocol, one packet is sent at a time."
The following are the problems associated with a stop and wait protocol:
"Suppose the sender sends the data and the data is lost. The receiver is waiting for the data for a long time. Since the data is not received by the receiver, so it does not send any acknowledgment. Since the sender does not receive any acknowledgment so it will not send the next packet. This problem occurs due to the lost data."
Sender waits for an infinite amount of time for an acknowledgment.
Receiver waits for an infinite amount of time for a data.
"Suppose the sender sends the data and it has also been received by the receiver. On receiving the packet, the receiver sends the acknowledgment. In this case, the acknowledgment is lost in a network, so there is no chance for the sender to receive the acknowledgment. There is also no chance for the sender to send the next packet as in stop and wait protocol, the next packet cannot be sent until the acknowledgment of the previous packet is received."
Sender waits for an infinite amount of time for an acknowledgment.
"Suppose the sender sends the data and it has also been received by the receiver. The receiver then sends the acknowledgment but the acknowledgment is received after the timeout period on the sender's side. As the acknowledgment is received late, so acknowledgment can be wrongly considered as the acknowledgment of some other data packet."
IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. It is an application layer protocol which is used to receive the emails from the mail server. It is the most commonly used protocols like POP3 for retrieving the emails.
"It also follows the client/server model. On one side, we have an IMAP client, which is a process running on a computer. On the other side, we have an IMAP server, which is also a process running on another computer. Both computers are connected through a network."
"The IMAP protocol resides on the TCP/IP transport layer which means that it implicitly uses the reliability of the protocol. Once the TCP connection is established between the IMAP client and IMAP server, the IMAP server listens to the port 143 by default, but this port number can also be changed."
Port 993: This port is used when IMAP client wants to connect through IMAP securely.
"POP3 is becoming the most popular protocol for accessing the TCP/IP mailboxes. It implements the offline mail access model, which means that the mails are retrieved from the mail server on the local machine, and then deleted from the mail server. Nowadays, millions of users use the POP3 protocol to access the incoming mails. Due to the offline mail access model, it cannot be used as much. The online model we would prefer in the ideal world. In the online model, we need to be connected to the internet always. The biggest problem with the offline access using POP3 is that the mails are permanently removed from the server, so multiple computers cannot access the mails. The solution to this problem is to store the mails at the remote server rather than on the local server. The POP3 also faces another issue, i.e., data security and safety. The solution to this problem is to use the disconnected access model, which provides the benefits of both online and offline access. In the disconnected access model, the user can retrieve the mail for local use as in the POP3 protocol, and the user does not need to be connected to the internet continuously. However, the changes made to the mailboxes are synchronized between the client and the server. The mail remains on the server so different applications in the future can access it. When developers recognized these benefits, they made some attempts to implement the disconnected access model. This is implemented by using the POP3 commands that provide the option to leave the mails on the server. This works, but only to a limited extent, for example, keeping track of which messages are new or old become an issue when both are retrieved and left on the server. So, the POP3 lacks some features which are required for the proper disconnected access model."
"In the mid-1980s, the development began at Stanford University on a new protocol that would provide a more capable way of accessing the user mailboxes. The result was the development of the interactive mail access protocol, which was later renamed as Internet Message Access Protocol."
"The first version of IMAP was formally documented as an internet standard was IMAP version 2, and in RFC 1064, and was published in July 1988. It was updated in RFC 1176, August 1990, retaining the same version. So they created a new document of version 3 known as IMAP3. In RFC 1203, which was published in February 1991. However, IMAP3 was never accepted by the market place, so people kept using IMAP2. The extension to the protocol was later created called IMAPbis, which added support for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to IMAP. This was a very important development due to the usefulness of MIME. Despite this, IMAPbis was never published as an RFC. This may be due to the problems associated with the IMAP3. In December 1994, IMAP version 4, i.e., IMAP4 was published in two RFCs, i.e., RFC 1730 describing the main protocol and RFC 1731 describing the authentication mechanism for IMAP 4. IMAP 4 is the current version of IMAP, which is widely used today. It continues to be refined, and its latest version is actually known as IMAP4rev1 and is defined in RFC 2060. It is most recently updated in RFC 3501."
"IMAP was designed for a specific purpose that provides a more flexible way of how the user accesses the mailbox. It can operate in any of the three modes, i.e., online, offline, and disconnected mode. Out of these, offline and disconnected modes are of interest to most users of the protocol."
Access and retrieve mail from remote server: The user can access the mail from the remote server while retaining the mails in the remote server.
Set message flags: The message flag is set so that the user can keep track of which message he has already seen.
Manage multiple mailboxes: The user can manage multiple mailboxes and transfer messages from one mailbox to another. The user can organize them into various categories for those who are working on various projects.
Determine information prior to downloading: It decides whether to retrieve or not before downloading the mail from the mail server.
"Downloads a portion of a message: It allows you to download the portion of a message, such as one body part from the mime-multi part. This can be useful when there are large multimedia files in a short-text element of a message."
"Organize mails on the server: In case of POP3, the user is not allowed to manage the mails on the server. On the other hand, the users can organize the mails on the server according to their requirements like they can create, delete or rename the mailbox on the server."
Search: Users can search for the contents of the emails.
Check email-header: Users can also check the email-header prior to downloading.
Create hierarchy: Users can also create the folders to organize the mails in a hierarchy.
"The IMAP is a client-server protocol like POP3 and most other TCP/IP application protocols. The IMAP4 protocol functions only when the IMAP4 must reside on the server where the user mailboxes are located. In c the POP3 does not necessarily require the same physical server that provides the SMTP services. Therefore, in the case of the IMAP protocol, the mailbox must be accessible to both SMTP for incoming mails and IMAP for retrieval and modifications."
The IMAP uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for communication to ensure the delivery of data and also received in the order.
"The IMAP4 listens on a well-known port, i.e., port number 143, for an incoming connection request from the IMAP4 client."
"The IMAP protocol synchronizes all the devices with the main server. Let's suppose we have three devices desktop, mobile, and laptop as shown in the above figure. If all these devices are accessing the same mailbox, then it will be synchronized with all the devices. Here, synchronization means that when mail is opened by one device, then it will be marked as opened in all the other devices, if we delete the mail, then the mail will also be deleted from all the other devices. So, we have synchronization between all the devices. In IMAP, we can see all the folders like spam, inbox, sent, etc. We can also create our own folder known as a custom folder that will be visible in all the other devices."
"The POP protocol stands for Post Office Protocol. As we know that SMTP is used as a message transfer agent. When the message is sent, then SMPT is used to deliver the message from the client to the server and then to the recipient server. But the message is sent from the recipient server to the actual server with the help of the Message Access Agent. The Message Access Agent contains two types of protocols, i.e., POP3 and IMAP."
"Suppose sender wants to send the mail to receiver. First mail is transmitted to the sender's mail server. Then, the mail is transmitted from the sender's mail server to the receiver's mail server over the internet. On receiving the mail at the receiver's mail server, the mail is then sent to the user. The whole process is done with the help of Email protocols. The transmission of mail from the sender to the sender's mail server and then to the receiver's mail server is done with the help of the SMTP protocol. At the receiver's mail server, the POP or IMAP protocol takes the data and transmits to the actual user."
"Since SMTP is a push protocol so it pushes the message from the client to the server. As we can observe in the above figure that SMTP pushes the message from the client to the recipient's mail server. The third stage of email communication requires a pull protocol, and POP is a pull protocol. When the mail is transmitted from the recipient mail server to the client which means that the client is pulling the mail from the server."
"The POP3 is a simple protocol and having very limited functionalities. In the case of the POP3 protocol, the POP3 client is installed on the recipient system while the POP3 server is installed on the recipient's mail server."
"The first version of post office protocol was first introduced in 1984 as RFC 918 by the internet engineering task force. The developers developed a simple and effective email protocol known as the POP3 protocol, which is used for retrieving the emails from the server. This provides the facility for accessing the mails offline rather than accessing the mailbox offline."
"In 1985, the post office protocol version 2 was introduced in RFC 937, but it was replaced with the post office protocol version 3 in 1988 with the publication of RFC 1081. Then, POP3 was revised for the next 10 years before it was published. Once it was refined completely, it got published on 1996."
"Although the POP3 protocol has undergone various enhancements, the developers maintained a basic principle that it follows a three-stage process at the time of mail retrieval between the client and the server. They tried to make this protocol very simple, and this simplicity makes this protocol very popular today."
"To establish the connection between the POP3 server and the POP3 client, the POP3 server asks for the user name to the POP3 client. If the username is found in the POP3 server, then it sends the ok message. It then asks for the password from the POP3 client; then the POP3 client sends the password to the POP3 server. If the password is matched, then the POP3 server sends the OK message, and the connection gets established. After the establishment of a connection, the client can see the list of mails on the POP3 mail server. In the list of mails, the user will get the email numbers and sizes from the server. Out of this list, the user can start the retrieval of mail."
"Once the client retrieves all the emails from the server, all the emails from the server are deleted. Therefore, we can say that the emails are restricted to a particular machine, so it would not be possible to access the same mails on another machine. This situation can be overcome by configuring the email settings to leave a copy of mail on the mail server."
"It allows the users to read the email offline. It requires an internet connection only at the time of downloading emails from the server. Once the mails are downloaded from the server, then all the downloaded mails reside on our PC or hard disk of our computer, which can be accessed without the internet. Therefore, we can say that the POP3 protocol does not require permanent internet connectivity."
It provides easy and fast access to the emails as they are already stored on our PC.
There is no limit on the size of the email which we receive or send.
It requires less server storage space as all the mails are stored on the local machine.
"There is maximum size on the mailbox, but it is limited by the size of the hard disk."
It is a simple protocol so it is one of the most popular protocols used today.
"If the emails are downloaded from the server, then all the mails are deleted from the server by default. So, mails cannot be accessed from other machines unless they are configured to leave a copy of the mail on the server."
Transferring the mail folder from the local machine to another machine can be difficult.
"Since all the attachments are stored on your local machine, there is a high risk of a virus attack if the virus scanner does not scan them. The virus attack can harm the computer."
The email folder which is downloaded from the mail server can also become corrupted.
"The mails are stored on the local machine, so anyone who sits on your machine can access the email folder."
"CIFS is an abbreviation of the Common Internet File System. It is a protocol of the network filesystem. This protocol provides the shared access to files, printers, and the serial ports between the machines on the network. It is used on those devices which run on the Windows Operating System."
"Common Internet File System was introduced as a specific or advanced version of Server Message Block (SMB), which was created by Microsoft in the year of 1996. It is basically used for sharing the files remotely via Internet Protocol (IP)."
This protocol is also used in embedded and appliance systems. NAS (Network Attached Storage) and SAN (Storage Area Network) are the recent storage products which are based on the CIFS.
This protocol enables the client to manipulate the files as same as if they were manipulating on the local computers. It also allows a group of users for sharing the document within corporate intranets. It provides various features which are not supported by NFS. This protocol is also supported by other OS such as Unix.
Client: The client is a user who initiates most of the messages and the implementation of a protocol.
Server: It stores the messages in the network and performs the functionality.
"Application: By using the application, clients access the files which are shared over the network."
Following are the important characteristics or features of the Common Internet File System:
"File Access: Clients can easily open, close, read, write, and seek the files over the network."
Authenticate Transfer: A client can easily create one or more secure contexts over the network so that there is no chance of data loss.
Resource Access: A client can concurrently access the one or more shared services on the target server.
Transport Independent: This protocol does not need any external protocol for passing the SMB messages between the client and the server.
Extended Attributes: Common Internet File System supports those attributes which come under the non-filesystem.
Flexible Connectivity: A single client can easily make one or more networks to each server.
"Notification: When the file content is modified by the client or any user, then the server notifies or specifies the modifications."
Safe Caching: This protocol enables the client or user to cache data for better performance.
"File and record locking: This protocol supports the locking for files and records. So, due to this, it does not allow another person for writing or opening the files."
Following steps describe how to share the file over the network:
Step 1. The client who is a user sends a request to the server that he/she wants to access.
"Step 2. After that, the server accepts the request which is sent by the client."
"Step 3. And then, the server sends the back response to the client."
"Step 4: And, at last, the server connected to other servers and then share the files to the client."
"SMB is an abbreviation of Server Message Block. CIFS is an abbreviation of the Common Internet File system. CIFS is a protocol which is a dialect of SMB, i.e., CIFS is an advanced version of SMB."
"DAS stands for Direct Attached Storage. It is a digital storage device connected directly to the server, workstation, or personal computer via the cable. In Direct Attached Storage, applications use the block-level access protocol for accessing the data."
"There is no need for any network to attach the device to the server or workstation. So, DAS (Direct Attached Storage) is not a part of the storage network. Some examples of this storage device are solid-state drive, hard drives, tape libraries, and optical disk drives."
"The System of DAS is attached directly to the computer through the HBA (Host Bus Adapter. As compared to NAS devices, its device attaches directly to the server without the network. The modern systems of this storage device include the integrated controllers of a disk array with the advanced features."
"It is a good choice for those small businesses, workgroups, and departments, which do not want to share the data across the enterprises. It is used in those places which require less number of hosts and servers."
Following are the two types of Direct Attached Storage (DAS):
"Internal DAS is a DAS in which the storage device is attached internally to the server or PC by the HBA. In this DAS, HBA is used for high-speed bus connectivity over a short distance."
"External DAS is a DAS in which the external storage device is directly connected to the server without any device. In this type of DAS, FCP and SCSI are the protocols which act as an interface between server and the storage device."
The following table describes the differences between the Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Network Attached Storage (NAS):
The following table describes the differences between the Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN):
"DIMM is an abbreviation of the Dual in-line Memory Module. It is also a computer memory, which is commonly known as the RAM stick. It installs in the memory cells of the motherboard. It is a module which is used in laptops, personal computers (Pcs), printers, and other devices."
"The memory chips of DIMM are DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), which is the most common category of main memory."
"As compared to SIMM (single in-line memory module), it has a 64-bit data path, which allows DIMMs to transfer data at a fast speed. DIMM is a module which comes in the replacement of SIMM. This memory module consumes 3.3 volts, which are comparatively lower."
The dual in-line memory module stores each bit of data in the separate memory cell.
"This type of DIMM is also called as Unregistered Memory. It is that type of DIMM, which is usually used on laptops and desktops. Unbuffered DIMMs run faster, and the cost of them is low. Unlike the registered DIMM, it is not stable. In this type of DIMM, instructions are sent directly to the memory module from the memory controller."
"In the systems, FB-DIMM is used as primary memory, which requires large volumes, such as servers and workstations. The architecture of FB-DIMM specifies the 'Advance Memory Buffer' (AMB), which is presented between the memory module and the controller of memory."
"Fully buffered DIMM uses the chips of advanced memory buffer (AMB) for increasing the reliability and maintaining the signal integrity. It is a memory technology which is also used for increasing the density of memory systems. The AMB bus is categorized into two buses. The first bus is a 14-bit read bus, and another is a 10-bit write bus."
This type of DIMM is also called as buffered DIMM. Registered DIMM is commonly used in those servers and applications which require stability and robustness.
"It is a good choice for our servers in most cases. The register memory module has a register which is presented between the DRAM modules and the memory controller of the system. As the additional circuit is required, so it is more expensive. Due to the use of buffers, the clock cycle is increased."
"The cost of this memory module is more than the unregistered memory module. So, the manufacturers of computers mostly used unregistered memory in laptops and desktops."
LRDIMM stands for the Load-Reduced Dual in-line Memory Module. This type of DIMM uses the memory buffer chip for reducing or minimizing the load on the memory controller and for increasing the memory speed.
"SODIMM or SO-DIMM is an abbreviation of small outline dual in-line memory module. This type of DIMM is present in both 72-pin and 144-pin configuration. It is widely used in those systems which have limited space, such as laptops and tablets."
"It is a memory module, which is built using the ICs (Integrated circuits)."
MicroDIMM is an abbreviation of a micro dual in-line memory module. It is a memory module which is smaller than the Small Outline DIMM.
This memory module presents in 144-pin SDRAM and 172-pin DDR. This type of DIMM is mainly used in notebook computers.
"In Computing, iSCSI stands for ""Internet SCSI"" or ""Internet Small Computer Systems Interface"". It is an internet protocol which works on the top of TCP (Transport Control Protocol). It is a protocol which is used for linking the data storage components or facilities."
"Using the SCSI commands over the TCP/IP network, it transfers the data over the intranet."
"It allows the block-level SCSI data transport between the client and the storage over the Transport control protocol/Internet protocol networks. It can also be used for transmitting the data over the LAN, WAN, or the internet."
It connects the computing devices to the network storage. This internet protocol uses the initiators for sending the commands of SCSI to the storage devices on the remote servers.
"Fibre Channel is also an iSCSI, which is used for creating the SAN (Storage Area Network). ISCI uses the two ports of TCP, whose names are 80 and 3260. It also offers the high-level encryption of data packets which are being transferred."
"In Iscsi, block-level data is transferred between the client (iSCSI initiator) and the storage device (iSCSI target). There are lots of iSCSI devices that allow this communication between the client and the storage devices."
"When an application or end-user sends a request to access a file, the server converts the SCSI commands into the iSCSI command, and after then packets are sent over the IP network using the point-to-point connection. When the packets have arrived at the receiving side, then the iSCSI protocol disassembles the packets. It then converts these packets into SCSI commands and, finally, issue them to the storage."
"One of the main benefits of iSCSI is that it uses the TCP/IP protocol to enable long-distance IP routing without the requirement of any external gateway hardware. And, it also increases flexibility by using the TCP/IP."
"It uses the standard ethernet, so there is no need for any expensive component to be built."
"As compared to the Fibre channel, it offers the cheap connectivity network for transferring the files at the block level."
Reusability is also another advantage of iSCSI. The existing server can also be reused for the iSCSI implementation.
"As it is used for block storage, so it is very fast and efficient than other file transfer protocols (FTP)."
"It is very simple to understand and configure, so users do not need much knowledge about the iSCSI storage system."
Network-attached Storage (Commonly known as NAS) is a file storage device which is connected to the network and enables multiple users to access data form the centralized disk capacity. The users on a LAN access the shared storage by the ethernet connection.
"This storage is fast, low-cost and offers all the advantages of a public cloud on the site. It uses file access protocols such as NFS, SMB, NCP, or AFP."
"NFS is a file-based protocol which is popular on Unix systems. SMB stands for Server Message Block, which is used with the Microsoft Windows systems. AFP is also a file access protocol that is used with the Apple computers."
"It is basically designed for those network systems, which may be processing millions of operations per minute. It supports the storage device for the organization, which need a reliable network system. It is more economical than the file servers and more versatile than the external disks."
The following table describes the differences between the Storage Area Network (SAN) and Network Attached Storage (NAS):
The following table describes the differences between the Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Network Attached Storage (NAS):
Following are the advantages or benefits of a Network Attached Storage (NAS):
The architecture of NAS is easy to install and configure.
Every user or client in the network can easily access to Network Attached Storage.
A main advantage of NAS is that it is more reliable than the simple hard disks.
Another big advantage of NAS is that it offers the consolidated storage space within the own network of an organization.
The devices of NAS are scalable and can be easily accessed remotely.
NAS is managed easily. It takes less time for storing and recovering the data from any computer over the LAN.
It offers an affordable option for both small businesses and homes for private cloud storage.
Following are the disadvantages or limitations of a Network Attached Storage (NAS):
The speed of transferring the data is not as fast as DAS.
Users also require basic knowledge of computer networks to use the NAS efficiently.
"Those users or clients who want to back up their data, then they cannot proceed directly. They can do it by using the installed operating system only."
NFS is an abbreviation of the Network File System. It is a protocol of a distributed file system. This protocol was developed by the Sun Microsystems in the year of 1984.
"It is an architecture of the client/server, which contains a client program, server program, and a protocol that helps for communication between the client and server."
It is that protocol which allows the users to access the data and files remotely over the network. Any user can easily implement the NFS protocol because it is an open standard. Any user can manipulate files as same as if they were on like other protocols. This protocol is also built on the ONC RPC system.
This protocol is mainly implemented on those computing environments where the centralized management of resources and data is critical. It uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for accessing and delivering the data and files.
"Network File System is a protocol that works on all the networks of IP-based. It is implemented in that client/server application in which the server of NFS manages the authorization, authentication, and clients. This protocol is used with Apple Mac OS, Unix, and Unix-like operating systems such as Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, AIX."
NVMe stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. The meaning of Non-Volatile is that the data in the storage is not erased when our computer reboots.
The protocol of NVMe is built on the top of PCIe lanes.
NVMe is a transport protocol for accessing the non-volatile storage with the technology known as PCI express. This interface is introduced in the year of 2013.
It is basically designed to allow the high-speed transfer of data between the computer components and system.
"NVMe is a faster way for the solid-state drives to communicate with their host systems. It is an optimized and high-controller scalable interface, which is mainly designed to address the need of Enterprise. It supports 64k of parallel command queues. It is much faster than the hard disks, which are limited to a single command queue."
"The drivers of NVMe is much faster than the drivers of SATA. The tasks of input and output performed by using NVMe drivers begin and finish faster than the older drivers, such as AHCI."
"It is available in various form factors. Some of the form factors in which NVMe technology is available are M.2, U.2, AIC ( Aid-in Card ), U.3, and PCIe."
The main benefit associated with the NVM express is that it improves the performance and helps to increase the IOPs.
The development of NVMe specifications starts in the year of 2007 when the first details of the new standard to access the non-volatile memory came out at Intel developer Forum.
"In April 2008, the NVMHCI 1.0 (first protocol) was completed and released on the web site of Intel. After then, the technical work on NVM Express started in the second half of the year 2009. The specifications of NVMe were introduced by the NVM Express workgroup. This workgroup includes more than ninety companies. The specification version 1.0 was released on 1st March in the year of 2011. And, version 1.1 was released on 11th October in the year of 2012. In version 1.1, major features are added. Because of the focus on its features, initially, NVMe 1.1 was known as ""Enterprise NVMHCI""."
"In January 2013, an update for the base NVMe specification, called version 1.0e, was introduced. The first drive of NVMe was announced by Samsung in July 2013. The name of this drive is XS1715 enterprise drive, which supported the 3GB per second read speed."
"SAN is an abbreviation of the Storage Area Network. Storage Area Network is a dedicated, specialized, and high-speed network which provides block-level data storage. It delivers the shared pool of storage devices to more than one server."
The main aim of SAN is to transfer the data between the server and storage device. It also allows for transferring the data between the storage systems.
Storage Area networks are mainly used for accessing storage devices such as tape libraries and disk-based devices from the servers.
"It is a dedicated network which is not accessible through the LAN. It consists of hosts, switches, and storage devices which are interconnected using the topologies, protocols, and technologies."
Following are the most common protocols of SAN (Storage Area Network):
It is the most commonly used protocol of the Storage Area Network. It is a mapping of SCSI command over the Fibre Channel (FC) network.
It stands for Internet SCSI or Internet Small Computer System Interface. It is the second-largest block or SAN protocol. It puts the SCSI commands inside an ethernet frame and then transports them over an Internet protocol (IP) ethernet.
"FCoE stands for ""Fibre Channel Over Internet"". It is a protocol which is similar to the iSCSI. It puts the Fibre channel inside the ethernet datagram and then transports over an IP Ethernet network."
"NVMe stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. It is also a protocol of SAN, which access the flash storage by the PCI Express bus."
The following table describes the difference between Storage Area Network and Network Attached Storage:
The following table describes the differences between the Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN):
Following are the advantages or benefits of a Storage Area Network (SAN):
"Security is also a main advantage of SAN. If users want to secure their data, then SAN is a good option to use. Users can easily implement various security measures on SAN."
"Storage devices can be easily added or removed from the network. If users need more storage, then they simply add the devices."
The cost of this storage network is low as compared to others.
Another big advantage of using the SAN (Storage Area Network) is better disk utilization.
"It is an interdomain routing protocol, and it uses the path-vector routing. It is a gateway protocol that is used to exchange routing information among the autonomous system on the internet."
"As we know that Border Gateway Protocol works on different autonomous systems, so we should know the history of BGP, types of autonomous systems, etc."
"The first network was ARPANET, which the department of defense developed, and the Advanced Research Project Agency designed it. In Arpanet, only one network exists, which was handled by the single administrator. All the routers were the part of the single network, and the routing was performed with the help of the GGP (Gateway to Gateway Routing Protocol). The GGP was the first protocol among all the routing protocols. The autonomous system numbers were not used in the GGP protocol."
"When the internet came into the market, then GGP started creating the problem. As the internet backbone became large due to which the routing table was also large, which led to the maintenance issue. To resolve this issue, the ARPANET was divided into multiple domains, known as autonomous systems. Each autonomous system can be handled individually, and each system has its own routing policy, and the autonomous system contains the small routing database. When the autonomous system concept was implemented, then the first routing protocol came known as RIP that runs on the single autonomous system. To connect the one autonomous system with another autonomous system, EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) protocol was developed. The EGP protocol was launched in 1984, defined in RFC 904. The EGP protocol was used for five years, but it had certain flaws due to which the new protocol known as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was developed in 1989, defined in RFC 1105."
BGP version 1: This version was released in 1989 and is defined in RFC 1105.
BGP version 4: It is the current version of BGP defined in RFC 1771.
"An autonomous system is a collection of networks that comes under the single common administrative domain. Or we can say that it is a collection of routers under the single administrative domain. For example, an organization can contain multiple routers having different locations, but the single autonomous number system will recognize them. Within the same autonomous system or same organization, we generally use IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) protocols like RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF. Suppose we want to communicate between two autonomous systems. In that case, we use EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocols). The protocol that is running on the internet or used to communicate between two different autonomous number systems is known as BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). The BGP is the only protocol that is running on the internet backbone or used to exchange the routes between two different autonomous number systems. Internet service providers use the BGP protocol to control all the routing information."
It is a standard protocol which can run on any window device.
It is an exterior gateway protocol that is used to exchange the routing information between two or more autonomous system numbers.
"It is specially designed for inter-domain routing, where interAS-domain routing means exchanging the routing information between two or more autonomous number system."
It is the only protocol that operates on the internet backbone.
"The BGP is a path vector protocol. Here, path vector is a method of sending the routes along with routing information."
"It sends updates to configure the neighborhood relationship manually. Suppose there are two routers R1 and R2. Then, R1 has to send the configure command saying that you are my neighbor. On the other side, R2 also has to send the configure command to R1, saying that R1 is a neighbor of R1. If both the configure commands match, then the neighborhood relationship will get developed between these two routers."
It is an application layer protocol and uses TCP protocol for reliability.
"It has lots of attributes like weight attribute, origin, etc. BGP supports a very rich number of attributes that can affect the path manipulation process."
"If the information is coming from the external autonomous system, then it uses 20 administrative distance. If the information is coming from the same autonomous system, then it uses 200 administrative distance."
"There is a possibility that when you are connecting to the internet, then you may be advertising route 10.0.0.0 to some autonomous system, then it is advertised to some other autonomous system. Then there is a possibility that the same route is coming back again. This creates a loop. But, in BGP, there is a rule that when the router sees its own AS number for example, as shown in the above figure, the network 180.10.0.0/16 is originating from the AS 100, and when it sends to the AS 200, it is going to carry its path information, i.e., 180.10.0.0/16 and AS 100. When AS 200 sends to the AS 300, AS 200 will send its path information 180.10.0.0/16 and AS path is 100 and then 200, which means that the route originates from AS 100, then reaches 200 and finally reaches to 300. When AS 300 sends to the AS 500, it will send the network information 180.10.0.0/16, and AS path is 100, 200, and then 300. If AS 500 sends to the AS 100, and AS 100 sees its own autonomous number inside the update, it will not accept it. In this way, BGP prevents the loop creation."
"It is a system that contains only one connection from one autonomous system to another autonomous system. The data traffic cannot be passed through the stub autonomous system. The Stub AS can be either a source or a sink. If we have one autonomous system, i.e., AS1, then it will have a single connection to another autonomous system, AS2. The AS1 can act either as a source or a sink. If it acts as a source, then the data moves from AS1 to AS2. If AS1 acts as a sink, means that the data gets consumed in AS1 which is coming from AS2, but the data will not move forward from AS1."
"It is an autonomous system that can have more than one connection to another autonomous system, but it can still be either a source or a sink for data traffic. There is no transient data traffic flow, which means that the data can be passed from one autonomous system."
"The transient autonomous system is a multihomed autonomous system, but it also provides transient traffic flow."
The BGP chooses the best route based on the attributes of the path.
"As we know that path-vector routing is used in the border gateway routing protocol, which contains the routing table that shows the path information. The path attributes provide the path information. The attributes that show or store the path information are known as path attributes. This list of attributes helps the receiving router to make a better decision while applying any policy. Let's see the different types of attributes. The path attribute is broadly classified into two categories:"
1. Well-known attribute: It is an attribute that should be recognized by every BGP router.
"Well-known mandatory: When BGP is going to advertise any network, but it also advertises extra information, and that information with path attributes information. The information includes AS path information, origin information, next-hop information. Here, mandatory means that it has to be present in all the BGP routing updates."
"Well-known discretionary: It is recognized by all the BGP routers and passed on to other BGP routers, but it is not mandatory to be present in an update."
"2. Optional attribute: It is an attribute that is not necessarily to be recognized by every BGP router. In short, we can say that it is not a mandatory attribute."
"Optional transitive: BGP may or may not recognize this attribute, but it is passed on to the other BGP neighbors. Here, transitive means that if the attribute is not recognized, then it is marked as a partial."
"Optional non-transitive: If the BGP cannot recognize the attribute, it ignores the update and does not advertise to another BGP router."
"BGP neighborship is similar to the OSPF neighborship, but there are few differences. BGP forms the neighboring relationship with the help of the TCP connection on port number 179 and then exchanges the BGP updates. They exchange the updates after forming the neighbor relationship. In BGP, the neighbor relationship is configured manually. BGP neighbors are also known as BGP peers or BGP speakers."
"IBGP (Internal BGP): If all the routers are neighbors of each other and belong to the same autonomous number system, the routers are referred to as an IBGP."
"EBGP (External BGP): If all the routers are neighbors of each other and they belong to the different autonomous number systems, then the routers are referred to as an EBGP."
Neighbor table: It contains the neighbors who are configured by the administrator manually. The neighbor relationship has to be manually configured by using the neighbor command.
The above commands are very useful to verify whether the neighbor relationship is up or not.
BGP forwarding table: It contains all the routes advertised in BGP and can be verified using the following command:
IP routing table: The IP routing table contains the best path routes required to reach the destination. The following command shows the best routing path:
"When we talk about the BGP, which means that the communication between the autonomous systems. Let's consider two autonomous systems having five nodes each."
"The internal BGP session is used to exchange information between the routers inside an autonomous system. In short, we can say that the routing information is exchanged between the routers of the same autonomous system."
The external BGP session is a session in which nodes or routers of different autonomous systems communicate with each other.
There are four different types of packets exist in BGP:
"Open: When the router wants to create a neighborhood relation with another router, it sends the Open packet."
Update: The update packet can be used in either of the two cases:
"It can be used to withdraw the destination, which has been advertised previously."
It can also be used to announce the route to the new destination.
"Keep Alive: The keep alive packet is exchanged regularly to tell other routers whether they are alive or not. For example, there are two routers, i.e., R1 and R2. The R1 sends the keep alive packet to R2 while R2 sends the keep alive packet to R1 so that R1 can get to know that R2 is alive, and R2 can get to know that R1 is alive."
Notification: The notification packet is sent when the router detects the error condition or close the connection.
Now we will see the format in which the packet travels. The following are the fields in a BGP packet format:
Marker: It is a 32-bit field which is used for the authentication purpose.
"Length: It is a 16-bit field that defines the total length of the message, including the header."
Type: It is an 8-bit field that defines the type of the packet.
"Before understanding the working of Go-Back-N ARQ, we first look at the sliding window protocol. As we know that the sliding window protocol is different from the stop-and-wait protocol. In the stop-and-wait protocol, the sender can send only one frame at a time and cannot send the next frame without receiving the acknowledgment of the previously sent frame, whereas, in the case of sliding window protocol, the multiple frames can be sent at a time. The variations of sliding window protocol are Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ. Let's understand 'what is Go-Back-N ARQ'."
"In Go-Back-N ARQ, N is the sender's window size. Suppose we say that Go-Back-3, which means that the three frames can be sent at a time before expecting the acknowledgment from the receiver."
"It uses the principle of protocol pipelining in which the multiple frames can be sent before receiving the acknowledgment of the first frame. If we have five frames and the concept is Go-Back-3, which means that the three frames can be sent, i.e., frame no 1, frame no 2, frame no 3 can be sent before expecting the acknowledgment of frame no 1."
"In Go-Back-N ARQ, the frames are numbered sequentially as Go-Back-N ARQ sends the multiple frames at a time that requires the numbering approach to distinguish the frame from another frame, and these numbers are known as the sequential numbers."
"The number of frames that can be sent at a time totally depends on the size of the sender's window. So, we can say that 'N' is the number of frames that can be sent at a time before receiving the acknowledgment from the receiver."
"If the acknowledgment of a frame is not received within an agreed-upon time period, then all the frames available in the current window will be retransmitted. Suppose we have sent the frame no 5, but we didn't receive the acknowledgment of frame no 5, and the current window is holding three frames, then these three frames will be retransmitted."
"The sequence number of the outbound frames depends upon the size of the sender's window. Suppose the sender's window size is 2, and we have ten frames to send, then the sequence numbers will not be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Let's understand through an example."
"If the size of the sender's window is 4 then the sequence number will be 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2, and so on."
"The number of bits in the sequence number is 2 to generate the binary sequence 00,01,10,11."
"Suppose there are a sender and a receiver, and let's assume that there are 11 frames to be sent. These frames are represented as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and these are the sequence numbers of the frames. Mainly, the sequence number is decided by the sender's window size. But, for the better understanding, we took the running sequence numbers, i.e., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Let's consider the window size as 4, which means that the four frames can be sent at a time before expecting the acknowledgment of the first frame."
"Step 1: Firstly, the sender will send the first four frames to the receiver, i.e., 0,1,2,3, and now the sender is expected to receive the acknowledgment of the 0th frame."
"Let's assume that the receiver has sent the acknowledgment for the 0 frame, and the receiver has successfully received it."
"The sender will then send the next frame, i.e., 4, and the window slides containing four frames (1,2,3,4)."
"The receiver will then send the acknowledgment for the frame no 1. After receiving the acknowledgment, the sender will send the next frame, i.e., frame no 5, and the window will slide having four frames (2,3,4,5)."
"Now, let's assume that the receiver is not acknowledging the frame no 2, either the frame is lost, or the acknowledgment is lost. Instead of sending the frame no 6, the sender Go-Back to 2, which is the first frame of the current window, retransmits all the frames in the current window, i.e., 2,3,4,5."
"In Go-Back-N, N determines the sender's window size, and the size of the receiver's window is always 1."
It does not consider the corrupted frames and simply discards them.
It does not accept the frames which are out of order and discards them.
"If the sender does not receive the acknowledgment, it leads to the retransmission of all the current window frames."
"Example 1: In GB4, if every 6th packet being transmitted is lost and if we have to spend 10 packets then how many transmissions are required?"
"Solution: Here, GB4 means that N is equal to 4. The size of the sender's window is 4."
"Step 1: As the window size is 4, so four packets are transferred at a time, i.e., packet no 1, packet no 2, packet no 3, and packet no 4."
"Step 2: Once the transfer of window size is completed, the sender receives the acknowledgment of the first frame, i.e., packet no1. As the acknowledgment receives, the sender sends the next packet, i.e., packet no 5. In this case, the window slides having four packets, i.e., 2,3,4,5 and excluded the packet 1 as the acknowledgment of the packet 1 has been received successfully."
"Step 3: Now, the sender receives the acknowledgment of packet 2. After receiving the acknowledgment for packet 2, the sender sends the next packet, i.e., packet no 6. As mentioned in the question that every 6th is being lost, so this 6th packet is lost, but the sender does not know that the 6th packet has been lost."
"Step 4: The sender receives the acknowledgment for the packet no 3. After receiving the acknowledgment of 3rd packet, the sender sends the next packet, i.e., 7th packet. The window will slide having four packets, i.e., 4, 5, 6, 7."
"Step 5: When the packet 7 has been sent, then the sender receives the acknowledgment for the packet no 4. When the sender has received the acknowledgment, then the sender sends the next packet, i.e., the 8th packet. The window will slide having four packets, i.e., 5, 6, 7, 8."
"Step 6: When the packet 8 is sent, then the sender receives the acknowledgment of packet 5. On receiving the acknowledgment of packet 5, the sender sends the next packet, i.e., 9th packet. The window will slide having four packets, i.e., 6, 7, 8, 9."
"Step 7: The current window is holding four packets, i.e., 6, 7, 8, 9, where the 6th packet is the first packet in the window. As we know, the 6th packet has been lost, so the sender receives the negative acknowledgment NAK(6). As we know that every 6th packet is being lost, so the counter will be restarted from 1. So, the counter values 1, 2, 3 are given to the 7th packet, 8th packet, 9th packet respectively."
"Step 8: As it is Go-BACK, so it retransmits all the packets of the current window. It will resend 6, 7, 8, 9. The counter values of 6, 7, 8, 9 are 4, 5, 6, 1, respectively. In this case, the 8th packet is lost as it has a 6-counter value, so the counter variable will again be restarted from 1."
"Step 9: After the retransmission, the sender receives the acknowledgment of packet 6. On receiving the acknowledgment of packet 6, the sender sends the 10th packet. Now, the current window is holding four packets, i.e., 7, 8, 9, 10."
"Step 10: When the 10th packet is sent, the sender receives the acknowledgment of packet 7. Now the current window is holding three packets, 8, 9 and 10. The counter values of 8, 9, 10 are 6, 1, 2."
"Step 11: As the 8th packet has 6 counter value which means that 8th packet has been lost, and the sender receives NAK (8)."
"Step 12: Since the sender has received the negative acknowledgment for the 8th packet, it resends all the packets of the current window, i.e., 8, 9, 10."
"Step 13: The counter values of 8, 9, 10 are 3, 4, 5, respectively, so their acknowledgments have been received successfully."
We conclude from the above figure that total 17 transmissions are required.
"RJ abbreviated for the Registered Jack. It used as a medium in telecommunications or network interface. It enables network devices to connect voice and data equipment. It is mainly used to connect different types of data equipment and telecommunication media to take services offered by the local services provider to exchange data for longer distances and shorter exchange carriers. These RJ cables are categorised on the basis of structure and functions, such as size, PIN number, and their reliability on different devices."
There are following types of RJ cable used in telephone line and to connect and share data among the connected systems.
"It stands for the Registered Jack11, containing a four-wire or six-wire telephone-type connector to connect telephones to wall plates. However, it supports up to six-wire; most of the old wired telephone lines use twisted-pair cables with four wires to connect to ISPs (Internet Service providers)."
"It is the RJ11-W, where the W denotes the wall mount. It is an extended version of the RJ11. It is used to create bridge connections to the telephone lines with various wall mount functionalities."
"It is a standard connector that uses 6P4C, i.e., six positions, four contacts modular connector. It is similar to RJ11 except that it uses two telephone cable lines and can be used as a modem connector in a computer."
It is a registered jack 21 designed with 50 conductors in such a way that it can handle 25 telephone lines simultaneously. It is mostly used in wide networks to operate in an organization with multiple switches and devices.
"It is a standard connector RJ25 that uses a 6P6C, six positions, six contacts modular connector. These modular plugs are used to connect three lines of telephone cable connectors."
"It is a widely used type of registered jack connector in Ethernet cables or network devices. It is similar to the telephone jack or connector for sharing the data over the local area network. The shape of RJ45 cable or Ethernet cable is wider than the telephone jack or RJ11, 14, 21 and 25. It is used to create a connection with both shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling in the star topology of the Ethernet network. RJ45 connectors are usually with 8P8C that means eight positions, eight contacts modular connectors with separate twisted pair for connecting computer and telephone lines, wall plates, patch panels and other networking devices."
"It is a type of registered jack connector that uses a twisted wire pair of cables and an eight-pin modular jack for data communication interfaces. The RJ48 uses the same type of plug and socket as we used in the RJ45 connector, but the RJ48 uses a different type of pin-out, where one pair of pins is used to transmit the signal, another pair of pins is used for receiving the signal, another pair of pins is used for draining the signal, and one more pair of pins is left unused. The RJ48 cable is divided into three parts such as the RJ48-C, used for a surface mount like T1 lines and requires 1, 2, 4, and 5 pins. The RJ48-S uses 56 kbps for digital lines of wall mount that use pins 1, 2, 7, and 8. The RJ48-X is used for complex troubleshooting jack requiring 1, 2, 4 and 5 pins."
"It is the same as RJ11, but it uses 8P8C connector that means it has eight positions and eight conductors modular to connect with twisted-pair cables in the network devices."
It can work with configuring mounting surfaces for connecting voice and data equipment.
It is used with different telephone lines to share data over the registered jack connector.
"There are many institutional academies, large organization, offices use RJ11, RJ12, RJ25, etc., because it can connect multiple telephone lines simultaneously."
It is also used to connect multiple computers using the Ethernet cable to share data over the local area network.
It can connect to cross-connections for more than two systems.
It is easy to install and configured with different devices.
"It is a reliable cable, and the connection speed with the telecommunication interface is high."
It is only used for the shortest distance to connect with telecommunication devices.
"Today most devices are wireless, so the use of registered jacks is becoming obsolete."
"Data communication is a telecommunication network to send and receive data between two or more computers over the same or different network. There are two ways to establish a connection before sending data from one device to another, that are Connection-Oriented and Connectionless Service. Connection-oriented service involves the creation and termination of the connection for sending the data between two or more devices. In contrast, connectionless service does not require establishing any connection and termination process for transferring the data over a network."
"A connection-oriented service is a network service that was designed and developed after the telephone system. A connection-oriented service is used to create an end to end connection between the sender and the receiver before transmitting the data over the same or different networks. In connection-oriented service, packets are transmitted to the receiver in the same order the sender has sent them. It uses a handshake method that creates a connection between the user and sender for transmitting the data over the network. Hence it is also known as a reliable network service."
"Suppose, a sender wants to send data to the receiver. Then, first, the sender sends a request packet to a receiver in the form of an SYN packet. After that, the receiver responds to the sender's request with an (SYN-ACK) signal/packets. That represents the confirmation is received by the receiver to start the communication between the sender and the receiver. Now a sender can send the message or data to the receiver."
"Similarly, a receiver can respond or send the data to the sender in the form of packets. After successfully exchanging or transmitting data, a sender can terminate the connection by sending a signal to the receiver. In this way, we can say that it is a reliable network service."
"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that allows communication between two or more computer devices by establishing connections in the same or different networks. It is the most important protocol that uses internet protocol to transfer the data from one end to another. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP. It ensures that the connection is established and maintained until the data packet is transferring between the sender and receiver is complete."
"A connection is similar to a postal system, in which each letter takes along different route paths from the source to the destination address. Connectionless service is used in the network system to transfer data from one end to another end without creating any connection. So it does not require establishing a connection before sending the data from the sender to the receiver. It is not a reliable network service because it does not guarantee the transfer of data packets to the receiver, and data packets can be received in any order to the receiver. Therefore we can say that the data packet does not follow a defined path. In connectionless service, the transmitted data packet is not received by the receiver due to network congestion, and the data may be lost."
"For example, a sender can directly send any data to the receiver without establishing any connection because it is a connectionless service. Data sent by the sender will be in the packet or data streams containing the receiver's address. In connectionless service, the data can be travelled and received in any order. However, it does not guarantee to transfer of the packets to the right destination."
"The UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that allows communication between two or more devices without establishing any connection. In this protocol, a sender sends the data packets to the receiver that holds the destination address. A UDP does not ensure to deliver the data packets to the correct destination, and it does not generate any acknowledgment about the sender's data. Similarly, it does not acknowledge the receiver about the data. Hence, it is an unreliable protocol."
"Cellular mobile services have been used all over the world for a long time and still evolving day by day. With these services, various communication services also evolved, and CDMA and GSM are two of them. CDMA and GSM are the two most important technology standards that are known for mobile communication. Both the GSM and CDMA converts the data from the mobile phone into radio waves. But these technologies are differentiated in the way in which the calls & data transfer takes place over a network. One of the key differences between CDMA and GSM is that GSM uses SIM cards to connect a mobile phone with its network, whereas CDMA does not need any SIM card and operates on ESNs (Electronic Serial Number). In this topic, we will understand what GSM and CDMA technologies are and how they differentiate from each other in detail."
"GSM or Global System for Mobile Communication is a digital mobile communication standard, which is used for transmitting and receiving data and voice signals over a network."
"It is also known as the second-generation standard for mobile networks or telecommunication, and it operates on a wedge spectrum."
GSM uses the TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) for separating the users & cells and transmitting the signals.
"Due to the GSM standard, various other wireless services such as GPRS(General Packet Radio Service), UMTS(Universal Mobile Radio System), and EDGE(Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) have also evolved."
"It operates on three different radio frequencies, which are 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz."
"Among these three frequencies, the 900MHz band frequency is used by the Original GSM system, and the 1800 MHz band frequency is used to provide the added support for increasing customers. The 1900MHz band is specifically used in the US (United States)."
"The GSM users have first taken advantage of the service Short Message System (SMS), by which the users can communicate with each other using text messages over the given network."
"With GSM technology, we can have a low-cost mobile set and base stations."
The data or voice signals are of high quality in GSM.
The GSM is compatible with ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)
"CDMA is an acronym for Code Division Multiple Access, which is also a radio telecommunication standard similar to GSM."
The CDMA came into existence in 2G and 3G generation as the protocol of wireless communication.
"It is based on the spread spectrum technology and makes optimal use of the available bandwidth. Since it uses the spread spectrum technology, hence allows each user to transmit the data over the entire frequency spectrum at any time."
The CDMA provides one of the most secure modes of communication due to its spread spectrum property.
"It is used in UHF or Ultra high-frequency cellular systems, with frequency bands ranging from 800MHz to 1900MHz."
It uses a fixed frequency spectrum in an efficient way.
It is compatible with other cellular technologies; hence it allows nation-wide roaming.
"The GSM is based on the wedge spectrum technology, also known as a carrier. This carrier is split into various time slots on the basis of TDMA technology, and each time slots are assigned to each user. Due to this, until one outgoing call is finished, no other user can access that slot. It uses FDMA to provide multiuser access by dividing the user frequencies."
"On the other hand, CDMA uses the spread spectrum technology and hence it makes optimal use of the available bandwidth. It enables each user to transfer the data over the entire frequency spectrum at any time."
"SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a smart card that contains the user identification information to identify the subscriber on a telephony device. In a GSM-based phone, a SIM card is required to make the data or call transmission. These cards can be easily replaced from one mobile phone to another with saved information."
"On the other hand, CDMA based devices do not require a SIM card; instead, it uses ESN (Electronic Serial Number). Since it does not use a SIM card, hence changing a device from another is difficult and required a proper procedure."
"The GSM standard is more flexible as compared to CDMA. It is because, in GSM, the SIM card can be inserted into any device and can be used. Whereas, CDMA mobile phone can only be used if ESN is registered in its database."
"If a CDMA stops working on a phone, we need to buy the new phone, whereas if a SIM stops working, we can use another SIM rather than changing the phone."
"The GSM works on the frequency spectrum ranging from 850 MHz to 1900 MHz, whereas CDMA also operates in the frequency range of 850MHz and 1900MHz."
"In GSM phones, there is 28 times more radiation exposure takes place as compared to CDMA phones."
"GSM phone continuously transmits wave pulses, whereas CDMA phones do not continuously produce such pulses."
"GSM is more used globally as compared to CDMA technology. Approx. 80% of the mobile networks across 210 countries use GSM compared to CDMA. The CDMA-based mobile phones are mostly used in the US, Canada, and Japan."
The CDMA provides more security as compared to GSM technology because it has inbuilt encryption and uses the spread spectrum for data transmission.
"In CDMA, the signal detection is much difficult than in GSM. Hence it is more secure."
"The data transfer rate is high in CDMA compared to GSM technology. In CDMA, EVDO data transfer technology is used, which provides a maximum download speed of 2 Mbps."
"On the other hand, GSM uses EDGE data transfer technology that provides a maximum download speed of 384 Kbps, which is much slower than CDMA."
"To check if your mobile phone is GSM-based or CDMA based, check the below points:"
"For iPhone users: Go to Settings→General→About→ check for the MEID, ESN, or IMEI number near the bottom of the menu."
"For Android users: Go to Settings→ System→About Phone→Click to Status, and check for the MEID, ESN, or IMEI number."
"In both cases, if you see the MEID or ESN number, then your phone is CDMA based. If you see the IMEI number, then your phone is a GSM-based phone. If you see both options, it means your device supports both technologies."
"As discussed above, the GSM phone makes use of SIM cards, whereas CDMA not. So, you can check on your mobile phone whether it contains a SIM slot or not. But due to widely spread of 4G LTE technology, most CDMA devices also use SIM cards, so this way of checking is less helpful now."
"Both GSM and CDMA have their own importance and depends on how both technologies are being used. Approximately 80% of the world uses GSM, and CDMA is used mostly in the US and somewhere in Canada and Japan."
"MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet."
"It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address)."
"It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16."
"It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific."
It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.
"It is provided by the device's vendor at the time of manufacturing and embedded in its NIC, which is ideally cannot be changed."
The ARP protocol is used to associate a logical address with a physical or MAC address.
"As we already had the IP address to communicate a computer to the internet, why we need the MAC address. The answer to this question is that every mac address is assigned to the NIC of a hardware device that helps to identify a device over a network."
"When we request a page to load on the internet, the request is responded and sent to our IP address."
"Both MAC and IP addresses are operated on different layers of the internet protocol suite. The MAC address works on layer 2 and helps identify the devices within the same broadcast network (such as the router). On the other hand, the IP addresses are used on layer 3 and help identify the devices on different networks."
"We have the IP address to identify the device through different networks, we still need a MAC address to find the devices on the same network."
"If a LAN network has two or more devices with the same MAC address, that network will not work."
"Suppose three devices A, B, and C are connected to a network through a switch. The MAC addresses of these devices are 11000ABB28FC, 00000ABB28FC, and 00000ABB28FC, respectively. The NIC of devices B and C have the same MAC address. If device A sends a data frame to the address 00000ABB28FC, the switch will fail to deliver this frame to the destination, as it has two recipients of this data frame."
"As we have already discussed in the above section, we cannot assign the MAC address to the device's NIC; it is preconfigured by the manufacturers. So, let's understand how it is configured and what format is selected."
"It is 12 digits or 6-byte hexadecimal number, which is represented in colon-hexadecimal notation format. It is divided into six octets, and each octet contains 8 bits."
The first three octets are used as the OUI or Organisationally Unique Identifier. These MAC prefixes are assigned to each organization or vendor by the IEEE Registration Authority Committee.
"Some example of OUI of known vendors are:
CC:46:D6 - Cisco
3C:5A:B4 - Google, Inc.

"The last three octets are NIC specific and used by the manufacturer to each NIC card. Vendors or manufacturers can use any sequence of digits to the NIC specific digits, but the prefix should be the same as provided by the IEEE."
The MAC address can be represented in below three formats:
"The Unicast MAC address represents the specific NIC on the network. A Unicast MAC address frame is only sent out to the interface which is assigned to a specific NIC and hence transmitted to the single destination device. If the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to zero, the frame is meant to reach only one destination NIC."
"Multicast addresses enables the source device to transmit a data frame to multiple devices or NICs. In Layer-2 (Ethernet) Multicast address, LSB (least significant bit) or first 3 bytes of the first octet of an address is set to one and reserved for the multicast addresses. The rest 24 bits are used by the device that wants to send the data in a group. The multicast address always starts with the prefix 01-00-5E."
"It represents all devices within a Network. In broadcast MAC address, Ethernet frames with ones in all bits of the destination address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) are known as a broadcast address. All these bits are the reserved addresses for the broadcast. Frames that are destined with MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF will reach every computer belong to that LAN segment. Hence if a source device wants to send the data to all the devices within a network, that can use the broadcast address as the destination MAC address."
"We can easily find or check the address of our computer device with any operating device. Every device connected to the home network contains a unique MAC address, but if your system has multiple network adapters, such as an Ethernet adapter or wireless adapter, each adapter or NIC has its own MAC address or physical address."
Follow the below steps to find the MAC addresses of a device on a different OS.
"2. In the given search box, type cmd to open the command prompt."
"3. Press the Enter key, and the command prompt window will display, as shown below image:"
"5. It will show different information, scroll down and look for the physical address. Each physical address is the MAC address of your device."
"As we can see in the above image, there are two physical addresses shown with different values, one is for the Ethernet adapter, and the other one is for the VMware network adapter."
Follow the below steps to find the MAC address on the Macintosh OS:
"Select the Apple icon or open the Apple Menu, and click on System Preferences."
Select the Wi-Fi option from here. It will show the Wi-Fi address or Airport Address displays; it is the MAC address of your device.
"MAC cloning is a way to fix the connectivity issues of the device with ISP. In this method, we need to set the MAC address of a device WAN port to be the similar MAC address of your PC or another device."
"The connectivity issue arises mainly when we add new MAC address to a network, and this issue can be fixed with the help of MAC cloning."
"For example, Some ISPs use the MAC address of your device when the service is installed. Now, if we place a router behind the cable modem or DSL modem, the ISP will not recognize the MAC address from the device's WAN port. For such a case, either you can call to ISP provider to register the MAC of your device, or you can clone the MAC address of the WAN port to the same as the computer MAC address."
Both the MAC address and IP address are the way to identify the device on the network. Following are some important differences between both:
"A modem is a box-type device that connects your home/office network directly to the internet. The router is also a box-type device that enables multiple computer systems (either wired or wireless) to simultaneously use the internet. Nowadays, both the devices are integrated and usually provided by the ISP(Internet Service Provider) when we take the new internet plan. But to get the internet connection for our home/office network, we need both modem and router either integrated or individual. Although most of the time people get confused to identify both the devices, both devices have two different roles on a network that we will know on this topic. In this topic, we will understand the difference between the modem and router, but before understanding the main differences, we will first understand what Modem and Router are, their features, how they work, and what feature makes them different."
A modem is a device that modulates or demodulates the signal. It maintains a dedicated connection with the ISP to get the internet connection for home or business.
It acts as a bridge between the internet/telephone line and the computer.
"The reason to use the modem for an internet connection is that both the internet and the computer take two different signals. It means that the internet sends the analog signal, but the computer system can only understand the digital signal. So, we need a device that can convert an analog signal to a digital signal and vice versa. To do this, we need a modem."
"It modulates the incoming analog signal from the internet to digital signal and directs it to the computer, and vice versa."
"Usually, we get the modem from the ISP only when we take a new internet plan."
"It also performs data compression, error correction and controls the flow of information. It speed-up the process of transmission of data by grouping the data and send it in one go."
As you must have understood till now that modem is responsible for modulating and demodulating the signal. The working principle of the modem is based on the same process.
The modem is placed between the telephone line and the computer system or router. It connects the devices with the ethernet port given in it. It connects the ISP(internet service provider) to the home network directly for the single PC. Or it is connected with the router to connect with multiple devices.
"The below diagram is converting the incoming analog signal coming from telephone-lines/optical fiber to a digital signal and sending it to the PC. Without a modem, we cannot connect to the internet."
The modem can be of various types based on data transmission and how it is installed. These types are given below:
The external modem is connected outside the computer system using a serial cable.
"The installation is very easy, and it also provides a high data transmission rate."
"It is expensive but still used due to its high-speed data transmission in offices, mostly to avoid interruption in network connectivity."
"As its name suggests, the internal modem is installed over a PC's motherboard, termed as the internal modem."
It looks similar to an electronic circuit and mounted into an expansion slot of the motherboard.
"The installation is complex, and its data transmission speed is also slow; hence it is used for the dedicated computer in homes/ or small spaces."
"Wireless modems are connected to the computer systems without any cable, and most people use these modems for their personal use."
These modems use radio frequencies to transmit the data through the air and also provides good transmission speed.
Dial-up modem establishes the internet connection by connecting the ISP to the computer using the conventional telephone line.
It uses a PSTN facility (Public Switched telephone network) and provides a transmission speed of 56kb/sec.
The cable modem is known as the broadband device as it allows the computer to communicate with ISP over a landline connection.
It is connected with the landline connection using the coaxial cable and with the computer using the ethernet.
DSL stands for Digital Subscriber line that allows the transmission of data over the normal telephone line.
"It provides a high data transmission speed, hence widely used in offices/homes."
It can be used to connect to a computer or router to provide the internet connection through the ethernet port or USB port.
"The DSL modems are of two types:

ADSL Modem
SDSL Modem"
Satellite modems are expensive modems and do not require any telephone connection for the internet.
It uses satellite technology to send or receive the data.
The speed of the modem is comparatively slower than DSL or cable Modem.
"As the name suggests, it allows transmitting the data in one direction only at a time."
"It means if it is receiving the signal from one end, at that time, it will stop receiving the signal at another end. Once the transmission of one end is completed, then only the other end can transmit the data."
The full-duplex modems can transmit the data from both ends at the same time.
It means it can receive the data from one end and the other end simultaneously without any interruption.
It splits the pair of wires for incoming and outgoing data carriers.
"With this split, it can transmit the same frequency on both ends."
It uses a pair of wires hence called two-wire modems. Only these two wires are used for incoming and outgoing carriers.
"There are mainly two functions that a modem performs, which are given below:"
Modulate and demodulate the electrical signal from analog to digital and digital to analog.
Provide a secure connection to protect against line overload and other connection problems.
The modem enables us to use the internet connection to connect with the entire world.
"As its name suggests, the router is a networking device responsible for routing the data packets from source to destination over a network. It distributes or routes the internet connection from the modem to all the networking devices, either wired or wireless, such as PC, Laptop, Mobile phone, tablet, etc. It also enables multiple devices to communicate with each other over the same network."
"In the early days, there were only single computer systems in homes. Nowadays, multiple devices need the internet to work on, so to provide internet connectivity to all the available devices within the home/office, we need routers."
"In a wired router, we need an ethernet cable to connect with it for the internet connection. Whereas, in a wireless router, we don't need any cable, and with the help of Wi-fi technology, we can connect our networking devices with it."
It also provides us the security features and makes our devices secure over the given network form any threat.
A router first connects the modem to other devices to allow communication between these devices and the internet.
Router routes/transmit the data packets with the defined IP address from one network to another or within a network. It does it by providing a local IP address to each device over the internet; it ensures the right destination so that data reach the right place rather than lost within the network.
It finds out the best and fastest path and then sends data packets from that path to the network's devices.
It works similar to the delivery package that has a defined address so that it can reach the right recipient only.
The main function of a router is to keep the network up & to run smoothly.
"To do this, they connect computers and other networking devices such as Mobile, tablets, printers, etc., to communicate with each other."
There are different types of the router; some popular types are given below:
Wireless routers are the most commonly used routers in offices and homes as they don't need any wire or cable to connect with networking devices.
"It provides a secure connection, and only authenticated users can access the network using the id & password."
It can be accessed by the n number of users within the specified range.
"As its name suggests, it requires a wire or cable to connect to the network devices."
Such routers are used mostly in schools or small offices to connect the PCs with the Ethernet cable.
"It also has a Wi-fi access point, and a mobile phone can be connected to it using the VOIP (Voice-over-Internet Protocol) technology."
It is connected to the ADSL modems to take the transmission data from the modem and distribute it to a further network.
"Edge router can be either Wired/Wireless types that transmit the data packet between two or more networks, not within a network."
"These routers are placed at the edge of networks, hence called Edge router, and connect with ISP or another network in an organization."
The main task of the edge router is to maintain smooth communication between the networks.
"The core routers are also wired/wireless routers, which distribute the data packets within a network, not between two networks."
These are designed to become the backbone of a network and allow the heavy transfer of data.
This software allows the computers and servers to operate like routers and share data packets similar to the physical ones.
"These are more flexible than the physical, as they can be scaled up as per the business requirement."
"The wireless routers are mostly used that enable most of the networking devices to connect easily at any time, without the worry of a bunch of wires."
"It can connect with the different architecture of networks such as Ethernet cable, Wi-fi, or WLAN."
It reduces the network traffic with the help of the collision feature.
It provides data packets to the correct destination with the best route using the routing table and intelligence.
"After discussing a lot about the modems and routers, we can conclude that to have an internet connection in the office/home, we need a modem, but it will be just for a single networking device. So, to distribute this data to other networking devices, we need routers. Nowadays, both devices come together in integrated form, it means modem and router in a single device, so we don't need two different devices."
"The switch and router are the two essential components of a network. Although both are the connecting devices in a network, and sometimes people assume them as the same, both have different functionality. In this topic, we will see how the switch and router are differentiated from each other."
"A switch is a networking device, which provides the facility to share the information & resources by connecting different network devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, within a small business network."
"With the help of a switch, the connected devices can share the data & information and communicate with each other."
"Without a switch, we cannot build a small business network and cannot connect devices within a building or campus."
"There are mainly two types of switches in the network, which are given below:"
"Unmanaged Switches
The unmanaged switches are mainly used for basic connectivity. These are mostly used in small networks or wherever only few more ports are required, such as at home, in a lab, or in a conference room. In unmanaged switches, there is no requirement for any configuration, which means by just plugging in, they will work."
"Managed Switches
Managed switches are more secure than unmanaged switch, and provide other features and flexibility because we can easily configure them to custom-fit our network. Hence, we can have the greater control, and can also better protect our network and improve service quality for those who access the network."
"As we know, each networking device contains a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address. When a device or computer sends an IP packet to another device, then switch put the IP packet with source MAC address and destination MAC address, and encapsulate it with a Frame, and then send it to another device."
"When Frame reaches the destination device, it is stripped, and the device gets the IP packets and reaches only that device, which matches the entered destination MAC address."
It can be directly connected to the workstations or devices.
"Networks with switches have less frame collision, and it is because switches develop the collision domain for each network."
It helps in reducing the workload on the individual host such as PCs.
A router is a networking device used to connect multiple switches and their corresponding networks to build a large network. These switches and their corresponding networks may be in a single location or different locations.
"A router is an intelligent device and responsible for routing the data packets from source to destination over a network. It also distributes or routes the internet connection from modem to all the networking devices either wired or wireless, such as PC, Laptop, Mobile phone, tablet, etc"
"It mainly performs two functions;

Creating and maintaining the local area network, 
Managing the entering & leaving data."
The router connects multiple networks and allows the networked devices & users to access the internet.
It works on the network layer & route the data packets through the shortest path across the network.
"Within a home or office, we have various networked devices such as PC, tablets, printers, etc., and with the router, these devices can be connected to the internet and form a network. A router first connects the modem to other devices to allow communication between these devices and the internet."
Router routes/transmit the data packets with the defined IP address from one network to another or within a network. It does it by providing a local IP address to each device over the internet; it ensures the right destination so that data reach the right place rather than lost within the network.
It finds out the best and fastest path and then sends data packets from that path to the devices connected within the network.
It works similar to the delivery package with a defined address to reach the right recipient only.
"There are mainly two types of the router, which are given below:"
Wireless routers are the most commonly used routers in offices and homes as they don't need any wire or cable to connect with networking devices.
"It provides a secure connection, and only authenticated users can access the network using the id & password."
"Using wireless router, internet can be accessed by the n number of users within the specified range."
"As its name suggests, it requires a wire or cable to connect to the network devices."
Such routers are mostly used in schools or small offices to connect the PCs with the Ethernet cable.
"It also has a Wi-fi access point, and a mobile phone can be connected to it using the VOIP (Voice-over-Internet Protocol) technology."
It is connected to the ADSL modems to take the transmission data from the modem and distribute it to a further network.
"The wireless routers are mostly used that enable most networking devices to connect easily at any time, without the worry of a bunch of wires."
"It can connect with the different architecture of the network, such as Ethernet cable, Wi-fi, or WLAN."
It reduces the network traffic with the help of the collision feature.
It provides data packets to the correct destination with the best route using the routing table and intelligence.
"The main function of a switch is to connect the end devices such as computers, printers, etc., whereas the main function of a router is to connect two different networks."
"A switch works on the data link layer of the OSI model; on the other hand, a router works on the network layer of the OSI model."
"The switch aims to determine the destination address of the received IP packet and forward it to the destination address. On the other hand, the router's main purpose is to find the smallest and best routes for the packets to reach the destination, determined using the routing table."
"There are various switching techniques such as circuit switching, packet switching, and message switching, which are used by a switch. In comparison, a router uses two routing techniques, which are adaptive routing and non-adaptive routing techniques."
"A switch stores MAC address in the lookup table or CAM table to get the source and destination addresses. In contrast, routers store the IP addresses in the routing table."
"As per the above discussion, we can conclude that both are important devices for setting up a network and both have their own significance in the network. However, to set up a home-based network and connect devices, we need a switch, and to connect two networks, we need a router."
"USB 2.0 and 3.0 are the two specifications of USB (Universal Serial Bus) that are used for connecting peripheral devices to the computers. Nowadays, most computers and other electronic devices are using USB 3.0 instead of 2.0 due to various advanced features of USB 3.0. In this topic, we will see the differences between USB 2.0 and 3.0 and what are new advanced features are there in 3.0, which are not in 2.0. Before starting, let's understand what USB and its specifications are."
"USB or Universal Serial Bus is a connecting interface standard that enables the computer or other electronic devices to connect and communicate with other peripheral devices such as Keyboard, MIC, Mouse, flash drive, etc."
The USB connectors can also be used as the power transmitting cables such as to charge the mobile phone or tablets and these connectors are replacing the other traditional types of charger cables.
"The first USB standard was released in the year 1996, and today there are four versions of USB specifications, which are USB 1.x, USB 2.x, USB 3.x, and USB 4."
USB 2.0 is USB standard and is also known as the high-speed USB. It was released in April 2000. Almost all the devices with USB compatibilities support USB 2.0.
"The devices that use USB 2.0 can transfer the data at a maximum speed of 480Mbps, which is faster than the USB 1.1 standard and slower than the USB 3.0 standard."
"The USB 2.0 standard provides support for the USB Mini-A, USB Mini-B, and USB Mini AB connectors."
"USB 3.0 is another USB standard, which was released in the year 2008. It is known as the Superspeed USB. Most of the new electronic devices and computers support this USB standard to enable faster communication between the devices."
"Devices that support & use USB 3.0 can transmit the data at a maximum speed of 5Gbps. It provides much faster data transfer compared to the USB 2.0 standard. The USB 3.0 has two updated versions, which are USB 3.1 and USB 3.2."
"There are various types of USB 3.0 connectors, which allow connecting two devices together. In 3.0 standard, USB Type A, Type B, Micro-A, and Micro-B, are the supported connectors."
The USB 3.0 standards can be distinguished by their blue-colored inserts and also has a 3.0 logo on them.
"There are five major factors by which we can differentiate the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, which are given below:"
"In both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, there are some physical differences, due to which anyone can easily identify both of the standards. The USB2.0 connectors are of white & black colored inside, whereas USB3.0 is usually of blue colored inside."
"The other physical difference is the number of connection wires. The USB 2.0 contains four connector wires, which support half-duplex communication. On the other hand, the 3.0 standard contains a total of 9 wires."
The five extra wires in USB 3.0 allow the two-ways or full-duplex communication and also increases the bandwidth.
"The data transfer speed between both standards is one of the major differences. The data transmission speed of USB 3.0 is extremely faster than USB 2.0, which makes it more suitable for today's devices to enable high-speed data transfer."
"The transfer rate of USB 2.0 is a maximum of 480 Mbps(Megabytes per second). This rate is very slow for the data transfer, but it is sufficient to connect peripheral devices such as Keyboard, mouse, headset, etc."
The data transfer rate of 3.0 standard is much higher(approx. 10 times) than 2.0 and can transfer the data at the maximum rate of
"However, it's the theoretical number of speed and practically it depends on specific drives. Such as the USB drive's speed depends on the speed of their flash memory."
The price is also the big factor to differentiate between both the standards. The products of USB 2.0 standards are less expensive than the products of USB 3.0 standards.
"USB 3.0 standard devices are much suitable if there is a requirement for high-speed data transfer, but for general use, the 2.0 standard products are also good."
The power management of USB 3.0 standard is much efficient compared to the 2.0 standard.
"USB 3.0 provides efficient power management with increased power delivery. It provides power usage upto 900mA, whereas the USB 2.0 standard provides power usages upto 500 mA, and hence increases the total power delivery from 2.5 W to 4.5 W."
It means the USB 3.0 devices can be charged faster. It also contains more power as per the requirement and conserves that power when the device is at an idle state.
"The USB 3.0 provides backward compatibility, which means, if it is connected to the 2.0 port, then the drive works fine, but with the speed of 2.0 standard. And if it is connected to the 3.0 port, then the speed will be higher."
"In the above sections, we have discussed the differences between the USB 2.0 standards and 3.0. So, now it is easy to make a selection between both the standards. As compared to 2.0, 3.0 is much efficient in various aspects such as transfer speed and power management, but it is much costly. So, if there is a requirement for high-speed data transfer and power management, we can choose USB 3.0 standard devices. But if we have a limited budget and for general use, we can choose the 2.0 standard."
"CSMA is a mechanism that senses the state of the shared channel to prevent or recover data packets from a collision. It is also used to control the flow of data packets over the network so that the packets are not get lost, and data integrity is maintained. In CSMA, when two or more data packets are sent at the same time on a shared channel, the chances of collision occurred. Due to the collision, the receiver does not get any information regarding the sender's data packets. And the lost information needs to be resented so that the receiver can get it. Therefore we need to sense the channel before transmitting data packets on a network. It is divided into two parts, CSMA CA (Collision Avoidance) and CSMA CD (Collision Detection)."
"The Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Detection protocol is used to detect a collision in the media access control (MAC) layer. Once the collision was detected, the CSMA CD immediately stopped the transmission by sending the signal so that the sender does not waste all the time to send the data packet. Suppose a collision is detected from each station while broadcasting the packets. In that case, the CSMA CD immediately sends a jam signal to stop transmission and waits for a random time context before transmitting another data packet. If the channel is found free, it immediately sends the data and returns it."
It is used for collision detection on a shared channel within a very short time.
CSMA CD is used to avoid any form of waste transmission.
"When necessary, it is used to use or share the same amount of bandwidth at each station."
It has lower CSMA CD overhead as compared to the CSMA CA.
"It is not suitable for long-distance networks because as the distance increases, CSMA CD' efficiency decreases."
"It can detect collision only up to 2500 meters, and beyond this range, it cannot detect collisions."
"When multiple devices are added to a CSMA CD, collision detection performance is reduced."
"CSMA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance. It means that it is a network protocol that uses to avoid a collision rather than allowing it to occur, and it does not deal with the recovery of packets after a collision. It is similar to the CSMA CD protocol that operates in the media access control layer. In CSMA CA, whenever a station sends a data frame to a channel, it checks whether it is in use. If the shared channel is busy, the station waits until the channel enters idle mode. Hence, we can say that it reduces the chances of collisions and makes better use of the medium to send data packets more efficiently."
"When the size of data packets is large, the chances of collision in CSMA CA is less."
It controls the data packets and sends the data when the receiver wants to send them.
It is used to prevent collision rather than collision detection on the shared channel.
CSMA CA avoids wasted transmission of data over the channel.
It is best suited for wireless transmission in a network.
It avoids unnecessary data traffic on the network with the help of the RTS/ CTS extension.
Sometime CSMA/CA takes much waiting time as usual to transmit the data packet.
"The data link layer is used in a computer network to transmit the data between two devices or nodes. It divides the layer into parts such as data link control and the multiple access resolution/protocol. The upper layer has the responsibility to flow control and the error control in the data link layer, and hence it is termed as logical of data link control. Whereas the lower sub-layer is used to handle and reduce the collision or multiple access on a channel. Hence it is termed as media access control or the multiple access resolutions."
"A data link control is a reliable channel for transmitting data over a dedicated link using various techniques such as framing, error control and flow control of data packets in the computer network."
"When a sender and receiver have a dedicated link to transmit data packets, the data link control is enough to handle the channel. Suppose there is no dedicated path to communicate or transfer the data between two devices. In that case, multiple stations access the channel and simultaneously transmits the data over the channel. It may create collision and cross talk. Hence, the multiple access protocol is required to reduce the collision and avoid crosstalk between the channels."
"For example, suppose that there is a classroom full of students. When a teacher asks a question, all the students (small channels) in the class start answering the question at the same time (transferring the data simultaneously). All the students respond at the same time due to which data is overlap or data lost. Therefore it is the responsibility of a teacher (multiple access protocol) to manage the students and make them one answer."
Following are the types of multiple access protocol that is subdivided into the different process as:
"In this protocol, all the station has the equal priority to send the data over a channel. In random access protocol, one or more stations cannot depend on another station nor any station control another station. Depending on the channel's state (idle or busy), each station transmits the data frame. However, if more than one station sends the data over a channel, there may be a collision or data conflict. Due to the collision, the data frame packets may be lost or changed. And hence, it does not receive by the receiver end."
Following are the different methods of random-access protocols for broadcasting frames on the channel.
"It is designed for wireless LAN (Local Area Network) but can also be used in a shared medium to transmit data. Using this method, any station can transmit data across a network simultaneously when a data frameset is available for transmission."
Any station can transmit data to a channel at any time.
Collision and data frames may be lost during the transmission of data through multiple stations.
"Acknowledgment of the frames exists in Aloha. Hence, there is no collision detection."
It requires retransmission of data after some random amount of time.
"Whenever data is available for sending over a channel at stations, we use Pure Aloha. In pure Aloha, when each station transmits data to a channel without checking whether the channel is idle or not, the chances of collision may occur, and the data frame can be lost. When any station transmits the data frame to a channel, the pure Aloha waits for the receiver's acknowledgment. If it does not acknowledge the receiver end within the specified time, the station waits for a random amount of time, called the backoff time (Tb). And the station may assume the frame has been lost or destroyed. Therefore, it retransmits the frame until all the data are successfully transmitted to the receiver."
The total vulnerable time of pure Aloha is 2 * Tfr.
Maximum throughput occurs when G = 1/ 2 that is 18.4%.
Successful transmission of data frame is S = G * e ^ - 2 G.
"As we can see in the figure above, there are four stations for accessing a shared channel and transmitting data frames. Some frames collide because most stations send their frames at the same time. Only two frames, frame 1.1 and frame 2.2, are successfully transmitted to the receiver end. At the same time, other frames are lost or destroyed. Whenever two frames fall on a shared channel simultaneously, collisions can occur, and both will suffer damage. If the new frame's first bit enters the channel before finishing the last bit of the second frame. Both frames are completely finished, and both stations must retransmit the data frame."
"The slotted Aloha is designed to overcome the pure Aloha's efficiency because pure Aloha has a very high possibility of frame hitting. In slotted Aloha, the shared channel is divided into a fixed time interval called slots. So that, if a station wants to send a frame to a shared channel, the frame can only be sent at the beginning of the slot, and only one frame is allowed to be sent to each slot. And if the stations are unable to send data to the beginning of the slot, the station will have to wait until the beginning of the slot for the next time. However, the possibility of a collision remains when trying to send a frame at the beginning of two or more station time slot."
Maximum throughput occurs in the slotted Aloha when G = 1 that is 37%.
The probability of successfully transmitting the data frame in the slotted Aloha is S = G * e ^ - 2 G.
The total vulnerable time required in slotted Aloha is Tfr.
"It is a carrier sense multiple access based on media access protocol to sense the traffic on a channel (idle or busy) before transmitting the data. It means that if the channel is idle, the station can send data to the channel. Otherwise, it must wait until the channel becomes idle. Hence, it reduces the chances of a collision on a transmission medium."
"1-Persistent: In the 1-Persistent mode of CSMA that defines each node, first sense the shared channel and if the channel is idle, it immediately sends the data. Else it must wait and keep track of the status of the channel to be idle and broadcast the frame unconditionally as soon as the channel is idle."
"Non-Persistent: It is the access mode of CSMA that defines before transmitting the data, each node must sense the channel, and if the channel is inactive, it immediately sends the data. Otherwise, the station must wait for a random time (not continuously), and when the channel is found to be idle, it transmits the frames."
"P-Persistent: It is the combination of 1-Persistent and Non-persistent modes. The P-Persistent mode defines that each node senses the channel, and if the channel is inactive, it sends a frame with a P probability. If the data is not transmitted, it waits for a (q = 1-p probability) random time and resumes the frame with the next time slot."
"O- Persistent: It is an O-persistent method that defines the superiority of the station before the transmission of the frame on the shared channel. If it is found that the channel is inactive, each station waits for its turn to retransmit the data."
"It is a carrier sense multiple access/ collision detection network protocol to transmit data frames. The CSMA/CD protocol works with a medium access control layer. Therefore, it first senses the shared channel before broadcasting the frames, and if the channel is idle, it transmits a frame to check whether the transmission was successful. If the frame is successfully received, the station sends another frame. If any collision is detected in the CSMA/CD, the station sends a jam/ stop signal to the shared channel to terminate data transmission. After that, it waits for a random time before sending a frame to a channel."
"It is a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance network protocol for carrier transmission of data frames. It is a protocol that works with a medium access control layer. When a data frame is sent to a channel, it receives an acknowledgment to check whether the channel is clear. If the station receives only a single (own) acknowledgments, that means the data frame has been successfully transmitted to the receiver. But if it gets two signals (its own and one more in which the collision of frames), a collision of the frame occurs in the shared channel. Detects the collision of the frame when a sender receives an acknowledgment signal."
Following are the methods used in the CSMA/ CA to avoid the collision:
"Interframe space: In this method, the station waits for the channel to become idle, and if it gets the channel is idle, it does not immediately send the data. Instead of this, it waits for some time, and this time period is called the Interframe space or IFS. However, the IFS time is often used to define the priority of the station."
"Contention window: In the Contention window, the total time is divided into different slots. When the station/ sender is ready to transmit the data frame, it chooses a random slot number of slots as wait time. If the channel is still busy, it does not restart the entire process, except that it restarts the timer only to send data packets when the channel is inactive."
"Acknowledgment: In the acknowledgment method, the sender station sends the data frame to the shared channel if the acknowledgment is not received ahead of time."
"It is a method of reducing data frame collision on a shared channel. In the controlled access method, each station interacts and decides to send a data frame by a particular station approved by all other stations. It means that a single station cannot send the data frames unless all other stations are not approved. It has three types of controlled access: Reservation, Polling, and Token Passing."
"It is a channelization protocol that allows the total usable bandwidth in a shared channel to be shared across multiple stations based on their time, distance and codes. It can access all the stations at the same time to send the data frames to the channel."
"Following are the various methods to access the channel based on their time, distance and codes:"
It is a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) method used to divide the available bandwidth into equal bands so that multiple users can send data through a different frequency to the subchannel. Each station is reserved with a particular band to prevent the crosstalk between the channels and interferences of stations.
"Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is a channel access method. It allows the same frequency bandwidth to be shared across multiple stations. And to avoid collisions in the shared channel, it divides the channel into different frequency slots that allocate stations to transmit the data frames. The same frequency bandwidth into the shared channel by dividing the signal into various time slots to transmit it. However, TDMA has an overhead of synchronization that specifies each station's time slot by adding synchronization bits to each slot."
"The code division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method. In CDMA, all stations can simultaneously send the data over the same channel. It means that it allows each station to transmit the data frames with full frequency on the shared channel at all times. It does not require the division of bandwidth on a shared channel based on time slots. If multiple stations send data to a channel simultaneously, their data frames are separated by a unique code sequence. Each station has a different unique code for transmitting the data over a shared channel. For example, there are multiple users in a room that are continuously speaking. Data is received by the users if only two-person interact with each other using the same language. Similarly, in the network, if different stations communicate with each other simultaneously with different code language."
"While surfing the internet or checking any website, you may have encountered the words ""URI"" and ""URL"" multiple times. These are the two important concepts of web and are mostly used interchangeably. But they are not the same as each other; the main difference between URI and URL is that URI can represent both URL and URN of a resource simultaneously, whereas URL can only specify the address of the resource on the internet. In this topic, we will see URI and URL individually and how both can be differentiated from each other."
"A URI or Uniform Resource Identifier is a string identifier that refers to a resource on the internet. It is a string of characters that is used to identify any resource on the internet using location, name, or both."
"A URI has two subsets; URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and URN (Uniform Resource Number). If it contains only a name, it means it is not a URL. Instead of directly URI, we mostly see the URL and URN in the real world."
"A URI contains scheme, authority, path, query, and a fragment. Some most common URI schemes are HTTP, HTTPs, ftp, Idap, telnet, etc."
"Scheme: The first component of URI is scheme that contain a sequence of characters that can be any combination of letter, digit, plus sign, or hyphen (_), which is followed by a colon (:). The popular schemes are http, file, ftp, data, and irc. The schemes should be registered with IANA."
"Authority: The authority component is optional and preceded by two slashes (//). It contains three sub-components:

userinfo: It may contain a username and an optional password separated by a colon. The sub-component is followed by the @ symbol.
host: It contains either a registered name or an IP address. The IP address must be enclosed within [] brackets.
Port: Optional"
userinfo: It may contain a username and an optional password separated by a colon. The sub-component is followed by the @ symbol.
host: It contains either a registered name or an IP address. The IP address must be enclosed within [] brackets.
"Path: It consists of a sequence of path segments separated by a slash(/). The URI always specifies it; however, the specified path may be empty or of 0 lengths."
"Query: It is an optional component, which is preceded by a question mark(?). It contains a query string of non-hierarchical data."
"Fragment: It is also an optional component, preceded by a hash(#) symbol. It consists of a fragment identifier that provides direction to a secondary resource."
"A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is used to find the location of the resource on the web. It is a reference for a resource and a way to access that resource. A URL always shows a unique resource, and it can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc."
"A URL uses a protocol for accessing the resource, which can be HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc."
"It is mainly referred to as the address of the website, which a user can find in their address bars. An example of an URL is given below:"
Each HTTP URL follow the syntax of its generic URI. Hence the syntax of the URL is also similar to the syntax of URI. It is given below:
The above URL is made up of the following components:
"Scheme: The URL's first component is a scheme, which represents a protocol that a browser must need to use to request the resource. The commonly used protocols for websites are HTTP or HTTPS."
"Authority: The authority includes two sub-components, domain name and Port, separated by a colon. The domain name can be anything, the registered name of the resource like javatpoint.com, and port is the technical gate to access the resource on a webserver. The port number 80 is used for HTTP and 443 is used for HTTPS."
Path: The path indicates the complete path to the resource on the webserver. It can be like /software/htp/index.html.
"Query String: It is the string that contains the name and value pair. If it is used in a URL, it follows the path component and gives the information. Such as ""?key1=value1&key2=value2""."
"Fragment: It is also an optional component, preceded by a hash(#) symbol. It consists of a fragment identifier that provides direction to a secondary resource."
"URI contains both URL and URN to identify the name and location or both of a resource; in contrast, URL is a subset of URI and only identifies the location of the resource."
"The example of URI is urn:isbn:0-476-27557-4, whereas the example of URL, is https://google.com."
"The URI can be used to find resources in HTML, XML, and other files also, whereas, URL can only be used to locate a web page."
"Each URL can be a URI, whereas all URIs cannot always be URLs."
"As per the above discussion, we can now differentiate between URI and URL. A URI is a sequence of characters that identifies a web resource by location, name, or both available on the internet. Whereas, URL is a sequence of characters that only identifies the location of a resource available on the internet."
"POP3 and IMAP are the popular email protocols that are used to access emails from a third-party email client or software. These two are the commonly used Email Protocols on the internet. Both these protocols help to connect to the mail server with the email client through which you have set up your email address. We can select any one of them to set up our email address. Similar to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), POP3 and IMAP also have specific functions and working principles. Let's discuss the POP3 and IMAP in detail, along with their differences."
IMAP is abbreviated as Internet Message Access Protocol. IMAP is an internet protocol that works on managing and retrieving emails on the remote server from a local client. It also works as MAA or Message Accessing Agent. Since IMAP deals with the retrieval of messages so we can't send emails using IMAP protocol on the internet. The IMAP protocol is supported by all email clients and web servers.
"If you are accessing your email from different devices like mobile, laptop and workstation desktop, etc., then it always better to use the IMAP protocol."
"There are some features of IMAP, which are as follows:"
Emails are stored on the server instead of an email client.
"Sent messages are also stored on the server-side in the sent folder, which allows us to check the sent email from anywhere."
You can synchronize the messages and access youremail from multiple devices.
It helps to download email data from AOL to your device or software.
We will not lose our emails even if our device is destroyed or stolen.
"The server also saves the status of the emails, such as read, unread, or replied. It helps to check the status of an email from any computer or device."
"When we start downloading emails using IMAP, it firstly shows the header (Sender, date, email subject); at that instant, we can decide whether to download the email or not."
"POP3 is abbreviated as Post Office Protocol, and the number three stands for ""version 3,"" which is the latest version and the most widely used email protocol on the internet. Similar to IMAP protocol, it is another protocol for receiving emails from remote servers. It also acts as a message accessing agent to retrieve the message from the mail server to the receiver's system. It helps to protect emails from spam and viruses on the internet."
POP3 works on two modes: Delete mode and Keep mode.
"It works on Delete mode when a user is accessing an email service from a permanent device. In this, once the mails are downloaded or retrieved from the mailbox, mails are deleted from the mailbox permanently."
"It operates on Keep mode when the user is not accessing mails from the primary device. In this, it keeps the mails after retrieval also for later retrieval."
We should use POP3 if we want to access mails using a single device
"In POP3, all the emails are downloaded to the local computer, and once all the emails are downloaded, they are deleted from the server."
"Emails are not synchronized between different devices, which means if we set up our email using our mobile phone with POP3, those emails will be downloaded completely on your mobile phone, and cant be accessed from other devices."
"As per the above discussion, we can conclude that IMAP is more powerful, and it is best to use it if we want to access our emails using multiple devices, for example, using smartphones and computers. On the other hand, POP3 is suitable if we access mails using one device only, with a large number of emails, and want to access those emails offline."
SSH stands for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell. It is a cryptographic network protocol that allows two computers to communicate and share the data over an insecure network such as the internet. It is used to login to a remote server to execute commands and data transfer from one machine to another machine.
The SSH protocol was developed by SSH communication security Ltd to safely communicate with the remote machine.
"Secure communication provides a strong password authentication and encrypted communication with a public key over an insecure channel. It is used to replace unprotected remote login protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, rsh, etc., and insecure file transfer protocol FTP."
Its security features are widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely.
"The SSH protocol protects the network from various attacks such as DNS spoofing, IP source routing, and IP spoofing."
"A simple example can be understood, such as suppose you want to transfer a package to one of your friends. Without SSH protocol, it can be opened and read by anyone. But if you will send it using SSH protocol, it will be encrypted and secured with the public keys, and only the receiver can open it."
It is an easy and secure way to transfer files from one system to another over an insecure network.
It helps the users to manage the network infrastructure and other critical system components.
"It is used to log in to shell on a remote system (Host), which replaces Telnet and rlogin and is used to execute a single command on the host, which replaces rsh."
"It combines with rsync utility to backup, copy, and mirror files with complete security and efficiency."
"By using SSH, we can set up the automatic login to a remote server such as OpenSSH."
"We can securely browse the web through the encrypted proxy connection with the SSH client, supporting the SOCKS protocol."
"The SSH protocol works in a client-server model, which means it connects a secure shell client application (End where the session is displayed) with the SSH server (End where session executes)."
"As discussed above, it was initially developed to replace insecure login protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, and hence it performs the same function."
"The basic use of SSH is to connect a remote system for a terminal session and to do this, following command is used:"
"The above command enables the client to connect to the server, named server.test.com, using the ID UserName."
"If we are connecting for the first time, it will prompt the remote host's public key fingerprint and ask to connect. The below message will be prompt:"
"To continue the session, we need to click yes, else no. If we click yes, then the host key will be stored in the known_hosts file of the local system. The key is contained within the hidden file by default, which is /.ssh/known_hosts in the home directory. Once the host key is stored in this hidden file, there is no need for further approval as the host key will automatically authenticate the connection."
"There are 3 versions of SSH, which are given below:"
"Version 1.x: The first version of SSH was launched in the year 1995 and designed by Tatu Ylönen, who was the researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland. It was known as SSH-1. In this version, there were several issues, and hence it got depreciated."
"Version 2.x: The second version is known as SSH-2, the current version of the SSH protocol. In 2006, it was opted as a Standards Track specification by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This version is not compatible with the SSH-1 protocol. It has better security features compared to SSH-1."
Version 1.99: Version 1.99 is specified as the proto version of 2.1. It is not the actual version but a way to identify the backward compatibility.
The SSH architecture is made-up of three well-separated layers. These layers are:
"The SSH protocol architecture is an open architecture; hence it provides great flexibility and enables SSH use for many other purposes instead of only a secure shell. In the architecture, the transport layer is similar to the transport layer security (TLS). The User-authentication layer can be used with the custom authentication methods, and the connection layer allows multiplexing different secondary sessions into a single SSH connection."
"The transport layer is the top layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite. For SSH-2, this layer is responsible for handling initial key exchange, server authentication, set up encryption, compression, and integrity verification. It works as an interface for sending and receiving plaintext packets with sizes up to 32, 768bytes."
"As its name suggests, the user authentication layer is responsible for handling client authentication and provides various authentication methods. The authentication is done at the client-side; hence when a prompt occurs for a password, it usually for an SSH client rather than a server, and the server responds to these authentications."
This layer includes various methods of authentication; these methods are:
Password: Password authentication is a straightforward way of authentication. It includes the feature to change the password for easy access. But it is not used by all the applications.
"Public-key: The public-key is a public key-based authentication method, which supports DSA, ECDSA, or RSA keypairs."
"Keyboard-interactive: It is one of the versatile authentication methods. In this, the server sends a prompt to enter information & the client sends it back with keyed-in responses by the user. It is used to provide a one-time password or OTP authentication."
"GSSAPI: In this method, the authentication is performed by external methods such as Kerberos 5 or NTLM, which provide the single sign-on capability to SSH sessions."
"The connection layer defines various channels through which SSH services are provided. It defines the concept of channels, channel requests, and global requests. One SSH connection can host different channels simultaneously and can also transfer data in both directions simultaneously. Channel requests are used in the connection layer to relay out-of-band channel-specific data, for example, the altered size of a terminal window or the exit code of a server-side process. The standard channel types of connection layer are:"
"shell: It is used for terminal shells, SFTP, and exec requests."
"The files are transferred using the SFTP(Secure file transfer protocol), the encrypted version of FTP that provides security to prevent any threat."
Telnet was the first internet application protocol used to create and maintain a terminal session on a remote host.
"Both SSH and Telnet have the same functionality. Still, the main difference is that SSH protocol is secured with public-key cryptography that authenticates endpoint while setting up a terminal session. On the other hand, no authentication is provided in Telnet for the user's authentication, making it less secure."
"SSH sends the encrypted data, while Telnet sends data in plain text."
"Due to high security, SSH is the preferred protocol for public networks, while due to less security, Telnet is suitable for private networks."
"SSH runs on port no 22 by default, but it can be changed, while Telnet uses port number 23, specifically designed for the Local area network."
"To make a secure transmission, SSH uses three different encryption techniques at various points during a transmission. These techniques are:"
Only one key can be used in symmetric encryption techniques to encrypt & decrypt messages sent and received from the destination. This technique is also known as shared key encryption because both devices use the same key to encrypt the data they send and decrypt the received data.
"This technique encrypts the entire SSH connection to prevent man-in-middle attacks. In this technique, one issue arises at the time of initial key exchange. As per this problem, if a third party is present during the key exchange, they could know the key and read the entire message."
"The Key exchange algorithm is used to prevent this problem. With this algorithm, the secret keys can be securely exchanged without an interception."
Asymmetrical encryption is required to implement the key exchange algorithm.
"In asymmetrical encryption, two different keys are used for encryption and decryption, private and public keys. The private key is private to the user only and cannot be shared with any other user, whereas the public key is shared publicly. The public key is saved on the SSH server, whereas the private key is saved locally on the SSH client; these two keys form a key pair. The message encrypted with the public key can only decrypt with the corresponding private key."
"It is a much secure technique as if a third party gets the public key, and they cannot decrypt the message because they don't know the private key."
"The asymmetrical encryption does not encrypt the complete SSH session. Instead, it is mainly used for the key exchange algorithm of symmetric encryption. In this, before establishing a connection, both systems (client and server) generate public-private key pairs temporarily and then share their private keys to generate the shared secret key."
"After establishing a secure symmetric connection, the server uses the public key to transmit it to the client for authentication. The client can only decrypt the data if it has the private key, and hence the SSH session establishes."
"In SSH, one-way hashing is used as the encryption technique, which is another form of cryptography. The hashing technique is different from the above two methods, as it is not meant by decryption. It generates the signature or summary of information. SSH uses HMAC(Hash-based Message authentication) to ensure that messages are reached in complete and unmodified form."
"In this technique, each transmitted message must have a MAC, which uses three components: symmetric key, packet sequence number, and message content. These three components form the hash function that generates a string that doesn't have any meaning, and this string is sent to the host. The host also has the same information, so they also generate a hash function, and if the generated hash matches with the received hash, it means the message is not tempered."
"Before going through the difference between UTP and STP cable, we need to learn the term twisted pair cable. A twisted pair cable is a widely used cable for transmitting data and information over certain distances. A twisted pair cable consists of two separate insulated copper wires that are twisted together within a wrapping shield and run parallel with each other. Furthermore, it helps to reduce the crosstalk or electromagnetic induction between the pair of wires. A twisted pair cable is divided into two parts as STP and UTP."
"UTP is an unshielded twisted pair cable used in computer and telecommunications mediums. Its frequency range is suitable for transmitting both data and voice via a UTP cable. Therefore, it is widely used in the telephone, computers, etc. It is a pair of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce noise generated by external interference. It is a wire with no additional shielding, like aluminium foil, to protect its data from the exterior."
It is a less costly and less expensive unshielded wire from another network medium.
"Its size is small, and hence the installation of the UTP is easier."
It is mostly useful for short-distance network connections like home and small organizations.
It is the most commonly used networking cable in the market. It is considered as faster copper-based data transmission cable.
It is suitable for transmitting both data and voice via UTP cable.
It can only be used in length segment up to 100 meters.
It does not provide a secure connection for data transmitting over the network.
"A shielded twisted pair is a type of twisted pair cable that contains an extra wrapping foil or copper braid jacket to protect the cable from defects like cuts, losing bandwidth, noise, and signal to the interference. It is a cable that is usually used underground, and therefore it is costly than UTP. It supports the higher data transmission rates across the long distance. We can also say it is a cable with metal sheath or coating that surround each pair of the insulated conductor to protect the wire from external users and prevent electromagnetic noise from penetrating."
Frequency: It has higher frequency data transmission as compared to the UTP.
Thickness: It is a thick shielded twisted pair cable as it contains the wrapping of plastic material to the copper conductor.
Grounding practices: The uses of shielded twisted pair cable are underground for a longer distance.
Installation of the shielded wire is more difficult than the UTP (Unshielded twisted pair) cable.
It is shielded with a plastic cover that protects the STP cable from a harsh environment and increases the data transmission rate.
It reduces the chances of crosstalk and protects from external interference.
A modular connection helps to terminate the connection of the STP cable.
It requires more maintenance to reduce the loss of data signals.
There is no segment improvement in length despite its thick and heavier connection.
"Following are the differences of the UTP and STP, as follows:"
"An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bad) State code 400 represents a user error. Whenever any user sends an invalid request to the server, the server immediately reports it and generates an HTTP based 400 bad request error. This error usually occurs if the user has entered an incorrect URL."
"In the broad majority of likely situations, the status code 400 error occurs due to a client-side problem caused by the submitted request to the server or local caching causes. Hence, in this tutorial, we will cover various easy methods that anyone can implement even if the user is not tech-savvy. Following the given methods, you should be successfully able to make your website working!"
"Status Code 400 or 400 Bad Request, or 400 error or HTTP error 400, is recognized by the server as a general user error. The server throws the 400 bad error if the server decides that the resulting error doesn't come under any other status code classifications."
"The 400 status code (Bad Request) represents that the server cannot process the request due to some user error. In return for an invalid request, the server should dispense the specific 4xx status code in the case of a failed request."
A 400 Bad Request error is mostly the consequence of typing the incorrect URL in the browser window or making errors in an address link while linking it from a web page to another.
"The primary reason for the HTTP error 400 to occur is an incorrectly typed URL (Uniform Resource Locator), deformed syntax, or a URL that contains some illegal characters."
"Though the user can mistakenly type the wrong URL, it can sometimes happen if the URL encoding has been performed incorrectly. The below-given link is an example of an incorrect URL that the server won't process, and therefore, it will trigger a 400 HTTP error."
"URL typo error is not the only case where the server triggers the 400 bad error. Even if the passed URL is 100% accurate, the server can still throw a 400 Bad Request error because it detects the presence of any corrupted files in the browser cache memory or other issues such as expired or damaged cookies."
"The user can also encounter a 400 Bad Request error if he/she tries to gain access to their WordPress admin area after some time of their last log-in session. The reason why it occurred because the process following which the cookie was managing the login authentication information may have gotten expired, and it cannot further authenticate the same valid user with admin rights. And it eventually results in the connection being declined and therefore passes 400 Bad Request error."
"The 400 Bad Request can occur if the local DNS data stored is not in sync with registered DNS (Domain Name server) data. All the domain names available on the internet are the art of IP address. You can compare the IP address of your phone number as it connects to a particular ""calling number"" you wish to dial."
A 400 Bad Request can also trigger if the files uploaded by the user on a website are too heavy for the upload request to be met. This is strictly associated with the server's file size limit and will change based on its setup.
"The 400 bad request error can also occur if there is any technical issue on the server-side. Though, a 400 status code will display a generic problem with the server, server or network glitch, or any other undefined volatile issues."
"Suppose it triggers when the user tries to connect to a third-party website, in that the user cannot control it. At that time, he/she can try to refresh the browser and monitor at frequent intervals whether the website developers have resolved the issue or not. Just in case you want to confirm whether the specific error is a server-side issue or not, try to load the website on various browsers, or you can also test it on a different machine/device to eliminate the system-specific problems."
"If the same issue occurs with other browsers, systems are also confirmed to be a server-side problem. If the site content is important for you, you directly communicate to the website owner and give all the details related to Operating System, browser, system, and versions you were using when you experienced the 400 bad error issue."
The various ways to fix the bad 400 errors are explained below:
One of the most common reasons for the 400 Bad Request error is the obvious URL string itself. One can easily make mistakes by manually typing unwanted characters in the URL in the web browser.
"Re-check the spelling of the domain name or the particular web page you want to access and make sure that they are typed accurately and are separated with forwarding slashes. If the URL includes any special characters, make sure they are encoded properly with valid URL characters."
"If you find it hard to check the URL spelling and encoding process repeatedly, you can opt for the online URL encoder/decoder. It is very useful for long URLs and less error-prone. These kinds of software help the user to identify various illegal characters in the URL automatically."
"Once you have entered the correct URL, it's time to run it again in the browser. Still, if you face the 400 Bad Request error, try with other fixing methods given below."
"While accessing specific website content, the user receives a 400 Bad Request error if any website files stored locally have been corrupted."
"It consists of all sorts of files that a website demands for its proper functioning, unlike:"
"Whenever any user visits any website, all the above files are stored locally on your computer's browser. Therefore to fix this problem, one should clear the browser's cache memory. Follow the below-given steps to clear the computer cache:"
"Open your browser (in our case, we have opened Google chrome), click on the three-dotted icon located on the top right-hand corner of the screen. It will throw a popup menu window (as shown in the given screenshot) -> select the More Tools"
"The following menu will appear, select the Clear Browsing Data option."
"It will direct you to the Clear browsing data window. Make sure to tick on the checkbox for the third option (Cached images and files), and once done, click on the Clear data button located at the bottom."
"Once done, reload the website again. Hopefully your website will run successfully this time!"
"If you are still facing the 400 error even after clearing your browser cache, in that case, your browser cookies are also corrupted. Whenever you open any website on your browser, it uses different cookies. If any one of the used cookies gets expired or corrupted, then it can trigger the 400 Bad Request error."
To clear your cookies in web browser (Chrome in our case) follow the below given steps:
"Open your browser (in our case, we have opened Google chrome), click on the three-dotted icon located on the top right-hand corner of the screen. It will throw a popup menu window (as shown in the given screenshot) -> select the More Tools"
"The following menu will appear, select the Clear Browsing Data option."
Tick on the checkbox for Cookies and other site data.
NOTE: Make sure to select the All-time option for the time range for the top as it will give option to delete all current website cookies.
"Once done, reload the website again. Hopefully, your website will run successfully this time!"
"While uploading a file, we often forget about the server size limit and exceed its maximum limit. Eventually, you confront a 400 Bad Request error."
"Try to upload a file again, and this time upload a smaller file. If it gets uploaded successfully, then the likely error occurred because the initial file was too large, and before uploading the file again, either you need to trim the file size or need to find some way."
The 400 Bad request can be triggered if the DNS data stored locally gets corrupted or out-of-date.
"Today, we install various extensions to our browser. Some extensions might affect your website cookies which could trigger the 400 bad request error. To find out the real culprit, temporarily disable them and check whether it makes a difference by running the website again."
"MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It is used to extend the capabilities of Internet e-mail protocols such as SMTP. The MIME protocol allows the users to exchange various types of digital content such as pictures, audio, video, and various types of documents and files in the e-mail. MIME was created in 1991 by a computer scientist named Nathan Borenstein at a company called Bell Communications."
"MIME is an e-mail extension protocol, i.e., it does not operate independently, but it helps to extend the capabilities of e-mail in collaboration with other protocols such as SMTP. Since MIME was able to transfer only text written file in a limited size English language with the help of the internet. At present, it is used by almost all e-mail related service companies such as Gmail, Yahoo-mail, Hotmail."
MIME protocol is used to transfer e-mail in the computer network for the following reasons:
"The MIME protocol supports multiple languages in e-mail, such as Hindi, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc."
"Simple protocols can reject mail that exceeds a certain size, but there is no word limit in MIME."
"Images, audio, and video cannot be sent using simple e-mail protocols such as SMTP. These require MIME protocol."
"Many times, emails are designed using code such as HTML and CSS, they are mainly used by companies for marketing their product. This type of code uses MIME to send email created from HTML and CSS."
MIME adds five additional fields to the header portion of the actual e-mail to extend the properties of the simple email protocol. These fields are as follows:
"It defines the version of the MIME protocol. This header usually has a parameter value 1.0, indicating that the message is formatted using MIME."
"It describes the type and subtype of information to be sent in the message. These messages can be of many types such as Text, Image, Audio, Video, and they also have many subtypes such that the subtype of the image can be png or jpeg. Similarly, the subtype of Video can be WEBM, MP4 etc."
"In this field, it is told which method has been used to convert mail information into ASCII or Binary number, such as 7-bit encoding, 8-bit encoding, etc."
"In this field, a unique ""Content Id"" number is appended to all email messages so that they can be uniquely identified."
"This field contains a brief description of the content within the email. This means that information about whatever is being sent in the mail is clearly in the ""Content Description"". This field also provides the information of name, creation date, and modification date of the file."
"It is capable of sending various types of files in a message, such as text, audio, video files."
"It also provides the facility to send and receive emails in different languages like Hindi, French, Japanese, Chinese etc."
"It also provides the facility of connecting HTML and CSS to email, due to which people can design email as per their requirement and make it attractive and beautiful."
It is capable of sending the information contained in an email regardless of its length.
"An IP address is the identifier that enables your device to send or receive data packets across the internet. It holds information related to your location and therefore making devices available for two-way communication. The internet requires a process to distinguish between different networks, routers, and websites. Therefore, IP addresses provide the mechanism of doing so, and it forms an indispensable part in the working of the internet. You will notice that most of the IP addresses are essentially numerical. Still, as the world is witnessing a colossal growth of network users, the network developers had to add letters and some addresses as internet usage grows."
An IP address is represented by a series of numbers segregated by periods(.). They are expressed in the form of four pairs - an example address might be 255.255.255.255 wherein each set can range from 0 to 255.
"IP addresses are not produced randomly. They are generated mathematically and are further assigned by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), a department of the ICANN."
ICANN stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It is a non-profit corporation founded in the US back in 1998 with an aim to manage Internet security and enable it to be available by all.
"Sometimes your device doesn't connect to your network the way you expect it to be, or you wish to troubleshoot why your network is not operating correctly. To answer the above questions, it is vital to learn the process with which IP addresses work."
"Internet Protocol or IP runs the same manner as other languages, i.e., applying the set guidelines to communicate the information. All devices obtain, send, and pass information with other associated devices with the help of this protocol only. By using the same language, the computers placed anywhere can communicate with one another."
The process of IP address works in the following way:
"Your computer, smartphone, or any other Wi-Fi-enabled device firstly connects to a network that is further connected to the internet. The network is responsible for giving your device access to the internet."
"While working from home, your device would be probably using that network provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). In a professional environment, your device uses your company network."
Your ISP is responsible to generate the IP address for your device.
"Your internet request penetrates through the ISP, and they place the requested data back to your device using your IP address. Since they provide you access to the internet, ISP's are responsible for allocating an IP address to your computer or respective device."
"Your IP address is never consistent and can change if there occurs any changes in its internal environment. For instance, if you turn your modem or router on or off, it will change your IP address. Or the user can also connect the ISP to change their IP address."
"When you are out of your home or office, mainly if you travel and carry your device with you, your computer won't be accessing your home IP address anymore. This is because you will be accessing the different networks (your phone hotspot, Wi-Fi at a cafe, resort, or airport, etc.) to connect the device with the internet. Therefore, your device will be allocated a different (temporary) IP address by the ISP of the hotel or cafe."
"There are various classifications of IP addresses, and each category further contains some types."
"Every individual or firm with an active internet service system pursues two types of IP addresses, i.e., Private IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and public IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. The public and private correlate to the network area. Therefore, a private IP address is practiced inside a network, whereas the other (public IP address) is practiced outside a network."
"All the devices that are linked with your internet network are allocated a private IP address. It holds computers, desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, or even Wi-Fi-enabled gadgets such as speakers, printers, or smart Televisions. With the expansion of IoT (internet of things), the demand for private IP addresses at individual homes is also seemingly growing. However, the router requires a method to identify these things distinctly. Therefore, your router produces unique private IP addresses that act as an identifier for every device using your internet network. Thus, differentiating them from one another on the network."
"A public IP address or primary address represents the whole network of devices associated with it. Every device included within with your primary address contains their own private IP address. ISP is responsible to provide your public IP address to your router. Typically, ISPs contains the bulk stock of IP addresses that they dispense to their clients. Your public IP address is practiced by every device to identify your network that is residing outside your internet network."
Public IP addresses are further classified into two categories- dynamic and static.
"Dynamic IP addresses
As the name suggests, Dynamic IP addresses change automatically and frequently. With this types of IP address, ISPs already purchase a bulk stock of IP addresses and allocate them in some order to their customers. Periodically, they re-allocate the IP addresses and place the used ones back into the IP addresses pool so they can be used later for another client. The foundation for this method is to make cost savings profits for the ISP."
"Static IP addresses
In comparison to dynamic IP addresses, static addresses are constant in nature. The network assigns the IP address to the device only once and, it remains consistent. Though most firms or individuals do not prefer to have a static IP address, it is essential to have a static IP address for an organization that wants to host its network server. It protects websites and email addresses linked with it with a constant IP address."
"The following classification is segregated into the two types of website IP addresses i.e., shared and dedicated."
"Many startups or individual website makers or various SME websites who don't want to invest initially in dedicated IP addresses can opt for shared hosting plans. Various web hosting providers are there in the market providing shared hosting services where two or more websites are hosted on the same server. Shared hosting is only feasible for websites that receive average traffic, the volumes are manageable, and the websites themselves are confined in terms of the webpages, etc."
"Web hosting providers also provide the option to acquire a dedicated IP address. Undoubtedly dedicated IP addresses are more secure, and they permit the users to run their File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. Therefore, it is easier to share and transfer data with many people within a business, and it also provides the option of anonymous FTP sharing. Another advantage of a dedicated IP addresses it the user can easily access the website using the IP address rather than typing the full domain name."
"The easiest method to find the public IP address of your router is to type ""What is my IP address?"" on Google.com. Google will immediately display the results on the screen."
There are some third-party websites available on the internet that also provides the same information. Those websites can access your public IP address because your router has requested to access their information by visiting their website.
Below are the steps to find your private IP address in two commonly used platforms:
Open the command prompt by typing the term 'cmd' (no quote marks) in the Windows search panel.
"The following window will appear. Type ""ipconfig"" (without the quotes) to access the private IP address information."
It will display the information regarding your private IP address.
Cybercriminals or digital crackers various ways to hack your IP address. The two commonly used techniques include social engineering and online stalking.
"Hackers can practice social engineering techniques to trick you into disclosing your device's IP address. For example, they will connect you through email, Skype, or a similar instantaneous messaging app, that accepts IP addresses to communicate and pass information. If you chat with these anonymous people using these messaging applications, it is essential to note that they can get your IP address. Cybercriminals can use a third-party tool named Skype Resolver, with the help of which they can locate your IP address using your username."
"Attackers can get crack your IP address by simply tracking your online activities. Any online activity can disclose your IP address, i.e., from using an instant messaging app to playing online games to discussing a topic on any digital websites and forums. Once they gain access to your IP address, criminals can visit an IP address tracking website (whatismyipaddress.com), they will enter your IP address there, and in no seconds, they can track your current location. They won't stop till this; they can further cross-check it with other available information to verify whether the IP address is connected with you particularly. Social networking sites such as instagram, LinkedIn, facebook are used to verify the information of your location gathered by the attacker."
"Every computer that is connected to the network has an IP (Internet Protocol) address that identifies the device uniquely. Similarly, the proxy server is a computer on the network that has its own IP address. But sometimes, we want to access those websites or servers that are restricted and we do not want to show our identity (IP address). In such a scenario, the proxy server comes into existence. We can achieve the same by using the proxy server. It provides varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy that depend on the use case, needs, or policies of the company. In this section, we will discuss what is a proxy server, its types, advantages, need, and working of proxy servers."
The proxy server is a computer on the internet that accepts the incoming requests from the client and forwards those requests to the destination server. It works as a gateway between the end-user and the internet. It has its own IP address. It separates the client system and web server from the global network.
"In other words, we can say that the proxy server allows us to access any websites with a different IP address. It plays an intermediary role between users and targeted websites or servers. It collects and provides information related to user requests. The most important point about a proxy server is that it does not encrypt traffic."
The following figure depicts the mechanism of the proxy server.
The proxy server accepts the request from the client and produces a response based on the following conditions:
"If the requested data or page already exists in the local cache, the proxy server itself provides the required retrieval to the client."
"If the requested data or page does not exist in the local cache, the proxy server forwards that request to the destination server."
The proxy servers transfer the replies to the client and also being cached to them.
"Therefore, it can be said that the proxy server acts as a client as well as the server."
There are many types of proxy servers available. The two most common types of proxy servers are forward and reverse proxy servers. The other proxy server has its own feature and advantages. Let's discuss each in detail.
"Open or Forward Proxy Server: It is the most widely recognized type of intermediary worker that is gotten to by the customer. An open or forward proxy server refers to those sorts of intermediaries that get demands from web clients and afterward peruse destinations to gather the mentioned information. After collecting the data from the sites, it forwards the data to the internet users directly. It bypasses the firewall made by authorities. The following image shows forward proxy configuration."
Reverse Proxy Server: It is a proxy server that is installed in the neighborhood of multiple other internal resources. It validated and processes a transaction in such a way that the clients do not communicate directly. The most popular reverse proxies are Varnish and Squid. The following image shows the reverse proxy configuration.
Split Proxy Server: It is implemented as two programs installed on two different computers.
Transparent Proxy: It is a proxy server that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and identification. It works on port 80.
Non-Transparent Proxy: It is an intermediary that alters the solicitation reaction to offer some extra types of assistance to the client. Web demands are straightforwardly shipped off the intermediary paying little mind to the worker from where they started.
Hostile Proxy: It is used to eavesdrop upon the data flow between the client machine and the web.
Intercepting Proxy Server: It combines the proxy server with a gateway. It is commonly used in businesses to prevent avoidance of acceptable use policy and ease of administration.
Forced Proxy Server: It is a combination of Intercepting and non-intercepting policies.
"Caching Proxy Server: Caching is servicing the request of clients with the help of saved contents from previous requests, without communicating with the specified server."
Web Proxy Server: The proxy that is targeted to the world wide web is known as a web proxy server.
Anonymous Proxy: The server tries to anonymizing the web surfing.
"Socks Proxy: It is an ITEF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard. It is just like a proxy system that supports proxy-aware applications. It does not allow the external network components to collects the information of the client that had generated the request. It consists of the following components:

A dient library for the SOCK.
A dient program such as FTP, telnet, or internet browser.
A SOCK server for the specified operating system."
"A dient program such as FTP, telnet, or internet browser."
High Anonymity Proxy: The proxy server that doesn't contain the proxy server type and the client IP address in a request header. Clients using the proxy can't be tracked.
"Rotating Proxy: It assigns a unique IP address to each client who is connected to it. It is ideal for users who do a lot of continuous web scrapping. It allows us to return the same website again and again. So, using the rotating proxy requires more attention."
"SSL Proxy Server: It decrypts the data between the client and the server. It means data is encrypted in both directions. Since proxy hides its existence from both the client and the server. It is best suited for organizations that enhance protection against threats. In SSL proxy, the content encrypted is not cached."
"Shared Proxy: A shared proxy server is used by more than one user at a time. It provides an IP address to the client that can be shared with other clients. It also allows users to select the location from where the user wants to search. It is ideal for users who do not want to spend a lot of money on a fast connection. Low cost is an advantage of it. The disadvantage of it is that a user can be get blamed for someone else's mischievous activity. For this reason, the user can be blocked from the site."
Public Proxy: A public proxy is available free of cost. It is perfect for the user for whom cost is a major concern while security and speed are not. Its speed is usually slow. Using a public proxy puts the user at high risk because information can be accessed by others on the internet.
"Residential Proxy: It assigns an IP address to a specific device. All requests made by the client channeled through that device. It is ideal for the users who want to verify ads that display on their websites. Using the residential proxy server, we can block unwanted and suspicious ads from competitors. In comparison to other proxy servers, the residential proxy server is more reliable."
Distorting Proxy: It is different from others because it identifies itself as a proxy to a website but hides its own identity. The actual IP address is changed by providing an incorrect one. It is perfect for clients who do not want to disclose their location during surfing.
"Data Center Proxy: It is a special type of proxy that is not affiliated with the ISP. It is provided by other corporations through a data center. These servers can be found in physical data centers. It is ideal for clients who want quick responses. It does not provide high-level anonymity. For this reason, it can put client information at high risk."
HTTP Proxy: HTTP proxies are those proxy servers that are used to save cache files of the browsed websites. It saves time and enhances the speed because cached files reside in the local memory. If the user again wants to access the same file proxy itself provides the same file without actually browsing the pages.
There are the following benefits of using the proxy server:
It improves the security and enhances the privacy of the user.
"Also, saves bandwidth by caching files and compressing incoming traffic."
It adds a subsidiary layer of security between server and outside traffic.
"As we have discussed above, the proxy server has its own IP address and it works as a gateway between the client and the internet. The client's computer knows the IP address of the proxy server. When the client sends a request on the internet, the request is re-routed to the proxy. After that, the proxy server gets the response from the destination or targeted server/site and forwards the data from the page to the client's browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)."
"Overall, it can be said that the proxy server accesses the targeted site, on behalf of the client, and collects all the requested information, and forwards them to the user (client). The following figure clearly depicts the working of the proxy server."
"Proxy server and VPN (Virtual Private Network) are quite similar. Both allow clients to hide their IP addresses, location and allows access to the restricted websites. The only difference is that the proxy server does not encrypt the traffic while VPN does the same. Another difference is that no one can track the activity of the VPN user while the activity of the proxy server user can be tracked."
The following table describes the key differences between the proxy server and VPN.
"A proxy server works as a bridge between a computer and the internet. It makes the internet a bit faster as well as provides more security and privacy. In this section, we will learn how to set up a proxy server in Windows PC and browsers. Also, we will learn how to use a proxy server."
"In Windows 10, the proxy setting is automatically detected, by default. We can set up proxy manually too. The basic approach to set up a proxy is that use the script address that should be maintained by the organization's network admin. Another approach is to set an automatic configuration script. Let's see how can we set up a proxy server in Windows and browsers."
Like other browsers internet explorer also use default Windows proxy configurations. Let's see the steps.
Click on the Tools icon presented at the top right corner.
Select the Internet options from the menu. It opens a dialog box.
Under the Proxy server label check Use a proxy server for your LAN as shown below.
"Provide the Address and Port of the proxy server that you want to use. In our case, we have provided address 91.132.139.178 whose port is 3128. You can choose a different one."
All done! We have set up a proxy server. Now we can access the internet anonymously.
"By default, Chrome uses Windows proxy and macOS. If we want to change the proxy setting follow the steps given below."
Click on the three dots present at the top right corner.
"From the menu, select the Settings option. It opens the chrome setting page."
Scroll down the page and click on the Advanced option.
"Again, scroll down the page and click on the Open your computer's proxy settings that are presented under the System label. It opens the Internet Properties dialog box."
Under the Proxy server label check Use a proxy server for your LAN as shown below.
"Provide the Address and Port of the proxy server that you want to use. In our case, we have provided address 91.132.139.178 whose port is 3128. You can choose a different one."
"All done! We have set up a proxy server. Now we can access the internet anonymously. Also, we observe that only a few steps are to be performed in the browser and then the process in your machine's operating system."
"Microsoft Edge is a Windows 10's built-in web browser. Until we will not tell it about proxy, it uses the Windows proxy configuration. It is the same as Chrome, hence the proxy configuration is similar. Let's see the steps to set up a proxy server in the Microsoft Edge browser."
Click on the three dots present at the top right corner.
"From the menu, select the Settings option. It opens the Edge setting page."
Click on the System option presented in the left pane.
Click on the Open your computer's proxy settings that are presented under the System label. It opens the Internet Properties dialog box.
Under the Proxy server label check Use a proxy server for your LAN as shown below.
"Provide the Address and Port of the proxy server that you want to use. In our case, we have provided address 91.132.139.178 whose port is 3128. You can choose a different one."
"All done! We have set up a proxy server. Now we can access the internet anonymously. Also, we observe that only a few steps are to be performed in the browser and then the process in your machine's operating system."
"Like other browsers, Firefox does not use the system's default proxy settings. If we want to use proxy in Firefox, we should follow the steps given below."
Click on the three horizontal lines presented at the top right corner.
Scroll down the page and go to Network Settings. Click on the Settings? button. It opens the Connection Settings dialog box.
"The dialog box shows the multiple options for configuring proxy access to the internet are as follows:

No proxy: If selected, no proxy is set up.
Auto-detect proxy settings for this network: The option automatically detects the proxy settings for the network you are using.
Use system proxy settings: It uses the operating system proxy setting.
Manual proxy configuration: By selecting the portion, we can set up proxy manually by providing HTTP, HTTPS, FTP Proxy, and corresponding Port.

In our case, we have selected the option Auto-detect proxy settings for this network."
Auto-detect proxy settings for this network: The option automatically detects the proxy settings for the network you are using.
Use system proxy settings: It uses the operating system proxy setting.
"Manual proxy configuration: By selecting the portion, we can set up proxy manually by providing HTTP, HTTPS, FTP Proxy, and corresponding Port."
"In our case, we have selected the option Auto-detect proxy settings for this network."
"After selecting any of the above options, click on the OK button to save the settings."
All done! We have set up a proxy server. Now we can access the internet anonymously.
Setting up a proxy server in Windows automatically includes the following steps:
Select Internet Options. It opens the Internet Options dialog box.
"Under the Automatic configuration label check the option Use automatic configuration script, as shown below."
"Provide the specified script address in the Address box. In our case, the script address is file://c:/proxy.pac. Because we have created a file (proxy configuration file) named PROXY.PAC (see below) to the C:\ directory. You can choose a directory of your choice."
All done! We have set up a proxy server. Now we can access the internet anonymously.
"It sometimes becomes necessary for the browser to pick up proxy settings from a configuration file that is saved as PROXY.PAC (where PAC stands for Proxy Auto Configuration). The file contains the proxy settings but can be used in some other situations too. For example, load-balancing, fault tolerance, etc."
"We can make any change to the PROXY.PAC file accordingly. In the following script, we see that there are multiple URLs are defined in order to bypass the proxy, and all the other URLs are defined to get through the proxy."
"Once the configuration file is created, we can continue with the step 6 and 7."
Setting up a proxy server in Windows automatically includes the following steps:
Select Internet Options. It opens the Internet Options dialog box.
"Under the Proxy server label, check the Use a proxy server for your LAN option, as shown below."
"In the Proxy Setting dialog box, provide proxy addresses (HTTP, FTP, Secure, Socks) and their Port to use. In our case, we have provided the following:

HTTP Proxy: 192.168.1.100, Port: 80 
FTP Proxy: 192.168.1.100, Port: 80
Secure Proxy: 192.168.1.100, Port: 80
Socks Proxy: 192.168.1.100, Port: 1080"
Open the browser and type https://whatismyipaddress.com/. It shows the IP address of the system. The following image shows the IP address of the system before using a proxy.
"When we set up a proxy, the IP address of the system will be changed to a different one."
After setting up the proxy we can access the internet like we have been accessing before. The only change is that the IP of the system changes.
We should use a proxy server if any of the following want to achieve:
"includes crucial organization information, clients' personal data, and legal files that, if leaked out, could lead to a big problem and data breach for the company. The security of data is only made achievable by executing beneficial network security policies and techniques."
Network security is the security designed to protect the integrity of the network from unauthorized access and threats. The network administrators are responsible for adopting various defensive measures to guard their networks from possible security risks.
"Computer networks are linked in daily transactions and communication within the government, private, or corporates that needs security. The most common and straightforward strategy of protecting network support is allocating it with a unique name and a corresponding password. The network security consists of:"
Protection: The user should be able to configure their devices and networks accurately.
Detection: The user must detect whether the configuration has changed or get a notification if there is any problem in the network traffic.
"Reaction: After detecting the problems, the user must respond to them and must return to a protected position as quickly as possible."
"Network security works with multiple layers of protection at the edge and in between the network. All the security layers execute some strategies and follow specified policies. Only the authorized users will obtain access to the network resources, and the illegitimate users will be blocked from conducting exploits and malicious activities."
"There are different layers to analyze while addressing any network security for an association. Though the attacks can occur at any layer in the network security model, all the network's constituent devices, unlike hardware, software, and policies, must be composed in sync to approach each division."
"The network security model is composed of three different controls: physical, technical, and administrative. Let's cover the brief analysis of network security and will learn how each control works."
"Physical security networks are developed to restrict unauthorized users from accessing various physical network devices, unlike routers, cabling cupboards, and so on. Every organization also requires checking the controlled access, unlike locks, biometric passwords, and other components."
"Technical security controls, safeguard the information, put on the network or transferred over, into, or out of the network. Protection is duplex; it requires protecting information and devices from the unofficial group, and it also needs to guard against unofficial exercises from workers."
"Administrative network security controls end-user behavior, including their authentication, level of access, and how the IT staff of any organization implements reforms to its infrastructure. Administration security includes various security policies and processes to its functioning."
Below given are some of the different methods that are commonly used in our day-to-day life to secure computer networks:
"Active security gadgets tackle the surplus traffic. For example, Firewalls, antivirus scanning tools, and content filtering appliances are the most commonly used active devices."
"Passive devices are used to recognize and block unwanted traffic, such as invasion detection devices."
Preventative devices are used to scan the networks and detect possible security threats. Penetration testing appliances and vulnerability assessment devices are the common examples of Preventative devices.
"UTM devices act as all-in-one security tools. Firewalls, content filtering, web caching are the common examples of Unified Threat Management."
"NAC is a technique for applying computer security networks at the most fundamental level. For instance, the user could allow administrators full access to the network but deny access to particular confidential files or restrict their system from connecting any network. It is a method that attempts to unite endpoint security technology that supports network security enforcement."
"Antivirus software's are designed to protect the system from a range of malware and malicious software, including viruses, worms, ransomware, and Trojans. The best software scans the malware, quarantines it and stops it before it causes any damage to the system."
"A firewall acts as a defense barrier between your trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks such as viruses, worms, Trojans, brute force attacks. A firewall could be of any form, i.e., software or hardware, unlike a router. Though both the method performs the same function, scanning incoming network traffic to make sure it doesn't contain blacklisted data."
"VPN supports the user in creating a secure and reliable private connection between the networks used by his computer or device to another network across the Internet. It handles the encryption process and uses other technologies to keep all your Internet activity safe and secure from attackers or cybercriminals who may be sneaking around when you connect your device with any public Wi-Fi. For instance, users working from home usually connect to the company's network via a VPN."
"Content filtering devices are used to filter offensive and nasty emails or web pages. This technique is implemented as a part of firewalls as well as in computers in companies. The content filtering devices generate the denial pop-up message displaying ""Access Denied"" if any unauthorized user attempts to access any official web page or email."
Content placed on the web is usually screened for obscene content or the content that spreads violence- or may contain hate-oriented information. Some organizations also screen and eliminate shopping and job-related content.
Content filtering can be classified in the below-given divisions: -
"Intrusion Detection Systems or Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems are the devices or the applications that actively monitor the network for malicious activities, log information about those activities, alert the company if the system detects an attack, and take steps to prevent them."
"Intrusion detection systems keep a list of malware signatures and compares incoming threats to the list. It instantly blocks any attack and resends the packets whose configuration matches the list, and reset the connection to protect the IP address from any blockage. The various other actions performed by Intrusion detection systems are as follows:"
It cleans up the unwanted transport and network layer options.
"Cloud is the need of the hour. Every organization wants to extend its data storage capabilities that can be easily maintained, shared, and accessed between their employees. Physical storage mediums are hard to manage and conk out after a while. Therefore more and more enterprises are shifting their data and computing requirements to cloud service providers. Cloud providers build hybrid infrastructures where their internal network can operate securely with third-party servers. To manage network security, various cloud providers have implemented centralized security control strategies on their platforms."
"WWW is a method of browsing all the online data present on the Internet. The users can seamlessly access the large universe of documents present on different websites from any corner of the world across the Internet with the help of their electronic devices such as computers, desktops, MacBooks, smartphones, etc."
This tutorial will briefly cover all the details related to the model on which WWW (World Wide Web) is based upon. If you want to learn regarding the definition and components of WWW in details refer to What is World Wide Web?
"World-Wide Web or WWW is created on the basic model of client-server concept and hypertext data objects. (You can refer to the pictorial diagram of the above model in the figure given below). With time, the WWW model has been expanded from a client-server application to a general resource accessing model."
"The above model indicates the initial concept of WWW represented in the HTTP Protocol (with a version of 0.9) and HTML applications (with a version of 1.0). However, the World Wide Web specs have been quickly developing during the last few years, even though the latest WWW approach is still based on a client-server model."
"Because the model is based on HTML and HTTP-based approaches, therefore WWW can handle virtually any information format present on the Internet with the help of a comprehensive collection of access methods aside from HTTP, unlike Telnet, FTP, Gopher WAIS, etc. In simple terms, the World-Wide Web works as a generic data interchange device to access data available across the Internet."
"Before moving to the latest advanced model of the World-Wide Web, it is necessary to cover all the vital components present in the WWW model. The brief explanation of all the elements present within the World-Wide Web concept is given below:"
"In the above flowchart, the client represents the user's interface that generates request to the server. The user interface remains consistent and works in the same manner with any form of service requested. Therefore users do not require to learn the variations between the many different access systems used every day on the Internet. The concept of the client model works with the same approach as other popular software's, unlike Microsoft Windows, Machintosh, etc., where the user is constantly presented with the corresponding Graphical User Interface (GUI interface)."
Every data object present over the internet has some associated address or a namespace linked with it that holds information about hosts and all the sources present on each host. The WWW model describes URIs as a generic syntax for encoding the namespace and addresses of information types on the web and it also defines the process to access them. The model of URIs includes.
"Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
URI is defined as a generic collection of all addresses in the address space of all data objects available on the web. They represent a hierarchical naming plot combined with the HTTP protocol creating a significant distinction between the WWW and other web access schemes."
"Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
URL is defined as the unique address of a specific resource that is available on the Web.. The URLs is designed on the concepts of the currently used Internet protocols supported by the WWW, i.e., HTTP, FTP, WAIS, etc. They are started with www followed by http/https/ftp with a specific directory path, their respective file name, and possibly a search directive."
"Uniform Resource Name (URN)
However, the ultimate goal for URIs is to be unique persistent identifiers that are allocated within the specified namespaces and are accessible for an extended period, even after the resource they classify discontinues to exist or becomes unavailable."
"Uniform Resource Citation (URC)
URC is used to store the Meta information of a URI. They hold the pairs of attribute/value which can have all the related information such as the content writer, publisher, published date, etc. Though, the concept of URC is not used in the current scenario."
"The primary application of the server is to handle all the requests sent from the user. It can either be a locally accessible device or ask for the request file or data from another server; in this scenario, the initial server temporarily acts as a client."
"HTTP or Hypertext Transport Protocol is a comprehensive stateless layer protocol containing the same components as other Internet layer protocols. The HTTP protocol is also designed on the client-server application model, where the server provides quick responses wherever the client generates any request."
The basic model of HTTP protocol format is designed on the guidelines of MIME Protocol with an assemblage of HTTP Headers likely supported by a message body holding a data object in any 7-bit or 8-bit received by the user interface. The user decides what format it can handle from the default list of standard headers in the request. The latest HTTP version (1.0) is designed and developed on the roots of the TCP Protocol. TCP is a connection oriented protocol that provides a 3 way handshake connection formation.
"The primary WWW model represents that the client is responsible for initiating a request. Further, the server handles that request and responds to it by sharing the respective data object back to the client. The client usually needs to post a data object to the server, for example, sending an email, creating a new file, or posting a newsgroup on the remote server. HTTP protocol offers two methods to transfer your data object from the client's device to the server. However, there is no surety that the request will be successfully made or not (not even on a successful return code) as the action can be canceled anytime by the accountable person of the remote server."
One of the HTTP protocol features is that it is a superset of the other Layer backed by the World Wide Web model. It indicates that the HTTP protocol can handle data objects produced by other protocols by binding them with various HTTP/MIME headers around the object. Therefore it is a vital feature for the notion of Proxy servers.
"HTML or Hypertext Markup language is defined as a users' interface language used to generate information on WWW (World-Wide Web). It is a hypertext markup language that supports the easy flow of communication over the network. Though, it is not mandatory to story the files within HTML. The servers can also store the document types in any format and then create its HTML type whenever it receives any file request from the client. Therefore we can conclude that it stores the documents virtually instead of static documents. HTML is widely used over the internet to represent the following:"
"Hypertext data, e-mail, digital document types or media, and collaborative hypermedia"
"Manageable structured data combined with multimedia components like images, music, and video."
HTML is designed on the International Standard ISO 8879 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) guidelines. SGML is a platform for describing structured data objects and markup languages to signify occurrences of the data objects or document type. Therefore HTML is also a Document Type Definition (DTD) applied on top of an SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) parser.
"The current WWW model is very interactive but is also designed on a client-server concept. The latest model is a generic resource exchange-based approach. The latest model allows the client to post data to the server (if the requested server also enables this service). In contrast, in the earlier model, the client has limited data flowing options, and it was mainly done from the server to the client. Furthermore, it has also introduced various data transfer formats in the message body ranging from 7-bit ASCII data to 8-bit binary data. In this model, any protocol can (supported by WWW) transfer source. Still, the prime protocol used in this model is HTTP, as it can be further applied to encapsulate the other protocols."
"A list of proxy servers describes all about the open HTTP/ SOCKS/ HTTPS proxy servers, their port and uptime of servers managed on a single website. It permits us to access the internet via indirect network connections. The list of proxy servers consists of computer IP addresses some of them host free proxy servers. The free proxy server can be accessed by anyone who is connected through a network."
"In this section, we have enlisted some proxy servers that can be used with software applications that support the use of proxies such as web browsers. The purpose of using a proxy is that masking the IP address of the system, hiding the geolocation of the user, allows the user to access the blocked content or website."
Most of the proxy lists includes web proxies that can be accessed without making any change in browser settings. The following tables shows the list of open HTTP IP addresses where those are freely available.
"If you are planning to configure a proxy server, first you should know about the following factors that will help you to select the right proxy server."
Port: Port is a two or four-digit number that allows the user to connect with the proxy server. It is mandatory while establishing a proxy connection.
"Uptime: Uptime is a measure of system reliability, expressed as the percentage of time a machine, typically a computer has been working and available. In short, we can say that uptime refers to the amount of time, the server is available for use as intended."
Proxy Speed: Proxy speed significantly affects the pace of the round trip (involves too many components in addition to the proxy) for an Internet data request. Commercial proxy services promote the processing speed of their proxy servers. The speed of servers measured in seconds or milliseconds.
"Anonymity: There are three types of anonymity:

Transparent: If proxy anonymity is transparent, it means that the target server knows the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the user is connected via proxy server.
Anonymous: If proxy anonymity is anonymous, it means that the target server does not know the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the user is connected via proxy server.
Elite: If proxy anonymity is elite, it means that the target server does not know the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the request is relayed via proxy server."
"Transparent: If proxy anonymity is transparent, it means that the target server knows the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the user is connected via proxy server."
"Anonymous: If proxy anonymity is anonymous, it means that the target server does not know the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the user is connected via proxy server."
"Elite: If proxy anonymity is elite, it means that the target server does not know the IP address of the system that we are using and also knows that the request is relayed via proxy server."
"Also, there are other HTTP IP addresses and the below tabular columns list all those:"
"This tutorial will discover the definition of computer networking, its types, computer networks work, networking concepts, commonly used terms, networking and internet, how it works, and network topologies."
"""A Computer Network is defined as a set of two or more computers that are linked together?either via wired cables or wireless networks i.e., WiFi?with the purpose of communicating, exchanging, sharing or distributing data, files and resources."""
"Computer Networks are built using a collection of hardware (such as routers, switches, hubs, and so forth) and networking software (such as operating systems, firewalls, or corporate applications)."
"Though one can also define the computer networks based on their geographic location, a LAN (local area network) connects computers in a definite physical dimension, such as home or within an office."
"In contrast, a MAN (Metropolitan area network) connects computers ranging between multiple buildings in a city."
"The Internet is the most significant example of WAN (Wide Area Network), connecting billions of networking devices across the world."
"One can also describe the concept of computer networking by its communicating protocols, the physical arrangement of its networking elements, how it manages network traffic, and it's functioning."
"Computer networks are globally used by businesses, the entertainment industry, education in the research field for communication and transferring their data from source to destination node."
"All the other technologies, including the internet, Google search, instant messaging apps, online video streaming, social media, email, cloud kitchen, cloud data storage, etc., all exist because of computer networks."
Below are the most common computer network types that are frequently used these days:
"LAN or Local Area Network is a group of devices connecting the computers and other devices such as switches, servers, printers, etc., over a short distance such as office, home. The commonly used LAN is Ethernet LAN. This network is used as it allows the user to transfer or share data, files, and resources."
"WLAN or Wireless local area network is similar to LAN with the difference that it uses wireless communication between devices instead of wired connections. WLAN typically involves a Wi-Fi router or wireless access point for devices, unlike smartphones, laptops, desktops, etc."
"CAN or Campus Area Network is a closed corporate communication network. A CAN is a mobile network that may contain a private or public part. CANs are widely used colleges, academies, and corporate sites."
MAN or Metropolitan Area Network is typically a more extensive network when compared to LANs but is smaller than WANs. This network ranges between several buildings in the same city. Man networks are connected via fiber optic cable (usually high-speed connection). Cities and government bodies usually manage MANs.
"PAN or Personal Area Network is a type of network used personally and usually serves one person. This network usually connects devices unlike your smartphones, laptop, or desktop to sync content and share small files, unlike songs, photos, videos, calendars, etc. These devices connect via wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Infrared, etc."
SAN or Storage Area Network is a specialized high-speed network that stores and provides access to block-level storage. It is a dedicated shared network that is used for cloud data storage that appears and works like a storage drive.
"SAN consists of various switches, servers, and disks array. One of the advantages of SAN is that it is fault-tolerant, which means if any switch or server goes down, the data can still be accessed."
VPN or Virtual Private Network is a secure tool that encrypts point-to-point Internet connection and hides the user's IP address and virtual location. It determines an encrypted network to boost user's online privacy so as their identity and data are inaccessible to hackers.
"WAN or Wide Area Network is the most significant network type connecting computers over a wide geographical area, such as a country, continent. WAN includes several LANs, MANs, and CANs. An example of WAN is the Internet, which connects billions of computers globally."
Some of the most commonly used terms in day-to-day networking life are as discussed below:
An IP address or Internet Protocol is a unique number that represents the address where you live on the Internet. Every device that is connected to the network has a string of numbers or IP addresses unlike house addresses.
"You won't find two devices connected to a network with an identical IP address. When your computer sends data to another different, the sent data contains a 'header' that further contains the devices' IP address, i.e., the source computer and the destination device."
"A node refers to a networking connection point where a connection occurs inside a network that further helps in receiving, transmitting, creating, or storing files or data."
"Multiple devices could be connected to the Internet or network using wired or wireless nodes. To form a network connection, one requires two or more nodes where each node carries its unique identification to obtain access, such as an IP address. Some examples of nodes are computers, printers, modems, switches, etc."
"A router is a physical networking device, which forwards data packets between networks. Routers do the data analysis, perform the traffic directing functions on the network, and define the top route for the data packets to reach their destination node. A data packet may have to surpass multiple routers present within the network until it reaches its destination."
"In a computer network, a switch is a device that connects other devices and helps in node-to-node communication by deciding the best way of transmitting data within a network (usually if there are multiple routes in a more extensive network)."
"Though a router also transmits information, it forwards the information only between networks, whereas a switches forwards data between nodes present in a single network."
"Switching is further classified into three types, which are as follows:"
"Circuit Switching: In this switching type, a secure communication path is established between nodes (or the sender and receiver) in a network. It establishes a dedicated connection path before transferring the data, and this path assures a good transmission bandwidth and prevents any other traffic from traveling on that path. For example, the Telephone network."
"Packet Switching: With this technique, a message is broken into independent components known as packets. Because of their small size, each packet is sent individually. The packets traveling through the network will have their source and destination IP address."
"Message Switching: This switching technique uses the store and forward mechanism. It sends the complete unit of the message from the source node, passing from multiple switches until it reaches its intermediary node. It is not suitable for real-time applications."
"A port allows the user to access multiple applications by identifying a connection between network devices. Each port is allocated a set of string numbers. If you relate the IP address to a hotel's address, you can refer to ports as the hotel room number. Network devices use port numbers to decide which application, service, or method is used to forward the detailed information or the data."
"Network cables are used as a connection medium between different computers and other network devices. Typical examples of network cable types are Ethernet cables, coaxial, and fiber optic. Though the selection of cable type usually depends on the size of the network, the organization of network components, and the distance between the network devices."
"The Internet is the major example of a WAN, which connects billions of computers globally. Internet follows standard protocols that facilitate communication between these network devices. Those protocols include:"
ISPs (Internet Service Providers) NSPs (Network Service Providers) effectively support the internet infrastructure. The infrastructure allows the transportation of data packets to the recipient device over the Internet.
"Internet is a giant hub of information, but this information is not sent to every computer connected to the Internet. The protocols and infrastructure are responsible for managing to share the precise information the user has requested."
"The Computer networks are formed by connecting multiple nodes such as computers, desktops, routers, hubs, and switches with the help of either wired cables (Ethernet, data cables, fiber optics) or wireless networks (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi). This network connection enables the nodes to communicate and exchange data over the network."
"Networks follow communication protocols to send, receive, create or forward data. Each note connected with a network is allocated a unique IP (Internet Protocol), the IP address used to identify a device and enables the other devices to identify it."
"Routers and Switches are the virtual or physical medium that supports and manages the communications between networks. Routers examine the data packets to conclude the best route, following which the data can easily reach its destination node. In contrast, Switches connect the devices if there are multiple routes in a more extensive network and facilitate node-to-node communication, ensuring that the data packets traveling across the network reach their destination node."
"""Network topology is defined as the arrangement of computers or nodes of a computer network to establish communication among all."""
"A node refers to a device that can transmit, receive, create, or store information. The nodes are connected via a network link that could be either wired (cables, Ethernet) or wireless (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)."
"To help build a successful network in different situations, topologies are further classified into several types.
Though there are several topologies but in this tutorial, we will discuss the commonly used ones, which are as follows:"
A Bus network topology supports a common transmission medium where each node is directly connected with the main network cable.
The data is transmitted through the main network cable and is received by all nodes simultaneously.
"A signal is generated through the source machine, which contains the address of the receiving machine. The signal travels in both the direction to all the nodes connected to the bus network until it reaches the destination node."
Bus topology is not fault-tolerant and has a limited cable length.
A Ring topology is a modified version of bus topology where every node is connected in a closed-loop forming peer-to-peer LAN topology.
"Every node in a ring topology has precisely two connections. The Adjacent node pairs are connected directly, whereas the non-adjacent nodes are indirectly connected via various nodes."
Ring topology supports a unidirectional communication pattern where sending and receiving of data occurs via TOKEN.
"In a Star network topology, every node is connected using a single central hub or switch."
"The hub or switch performs the entire centralized administration. Each node sends its data to the hub, and later hub shares the received information to the destination device."
Two or more-star topologies can be connected to each other with the help of a repeater.
"In a Mesh topology, every node in the network connection is directly connected to one other forming overlapping connections between the nodes."
"This topology delivers better fault tolerance because if any network device fails, it won't affect the network, as other devices can transfer information."
"The Mesh networks self-configure and self-organize, finding the quickest, most secure way to transmit the data."
"One can form a full mesh topology by connecting every single node to another node in the network. Full mesh is expensive and is only used in the networks, which demands high data redundancy."
"Another type of mesh topology is partial mesh topology, where only a few devices are connected, and few are connected to the devices with which they share the most information. This mesh type is applicable in the networks, requiring less redundancy or a cost-effective network topology that is easy to execute."
"IP address is a short form of ""Internet Protocol Address."" It is a unique number provided to every device connected to the internet network, such as Android phone, laptop, Mac, etc. An IP address is represented in an integer number separated by a dot (.), for example, 192.167.12.46."
An IP address is categorized into two different types based on the number of IP address it contains. These are:
"IPv4 is version 4 of IP. It is a current version and the most commonly used IP address. It is a 32-bit address written in four numbers separated by a dot (.), i.e., periods. This address is unique for each device. For example, 66.94.29.13"
"IPv4 produces 4 billion addresses, and the developers think that these addresses are enough, but they were wrong. IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple header as compared to IPv4."
"To know more about the difference between IPv4 and IPv6, look at our article ipv4 vs. ipv6."
"Originally IP addresses were divided into five different categories called classes. These divided IP classes are class A, class B, class C, class D, and class E. Out of these, classes A, B, and C are most important. Each address class defines a different number of bits for its network prefix (network address) and host number (host address). The starting address bits decide from which class an address belongs."
"Network Address: The network address specifies the unique number which is assigned to your network. In the above figure, the network address takes two bytes of IP address."
"Host Address: A host address is a specific address number assigned to each host machine. With the help of the host address, each machine is identified in your network. The network address will be the same for each host in a network, but they must vary in host address."
"The address format of IPv4 is represented into 4-octets (32-bit), which is divided into three different classes, namely class A, class B, and class C."
"The above diagram shows the address format of IPv4. An IPv4 is a 32-bit decimal address. It contains four octets or fields separated by 'dot,' and each field is 8-bit in size. The number that each field contains should be in the range of 0-255."
"Class A address uses only first higher order octet (byte) to identify the network prefix, and remaining three octets (bytes) are used to define the individual host addresses. The class A address ranges between 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255. The first bit of the first octet is always set to 0 (zero), and next 7 bits determine network address, and the remaining 24 bits determine host address. So the first octet ranges from 0 to 127 (00000000 to 01111111)."
"Class B addresses use the initial two octets (two bytes) to identify the network prefix, and the remaining two octets (two bytes) define host addresses. The class B addresses are range between 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255. The first two bits of the first higher octet is always set to 10 (one and zero bit), and next 14 bits determines the network address and remaining 16 bits determines the host address. So the first octet ranges from 128 to 191 (10000000 to 10111111)."
"Class C addresses use the first three octets (three bytes) to identify the network prefix, and the remaining last octet (one byte) defines the host address. The class C address ranges between 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255. The first three bit of the first octet is always set to 110, and next 21 bits specify network address and remaining 8 bits specify the host address. Its first octet ranges from 192 to 223 (11000000 to 11011111)."
"Class D IP address is reserved for multicast addresses. Its first four bits of the first octet are always set to 1110, and the remaining bits determine the host address in any IP address. The first higher octet bits are always set to 1110, and the remaining bits specify the host address. The class D address ranges between 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. In multicasting, data is not assigned to any particular host machine, so it is not require to find the host address from the IP address, and also, there is no subnet mask present in class D."
"Class E IP address is reserved for experimental purposes and future use. It does not contain any subnet mask in it. The first higher octet bits are always set to 1111, and next remaining bits specify the host address. Class E address ranges between 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255."
"In every IP address class, all host-number bits are specified by a power of 2 that indicates the total numbers of the host's address that can create for a particular network address. Class A address can contain the maximum number of 224 (16,777,216) host numbers. Class B addresses contain the maximum number of 216 (65, 536) host numbers. And class C contains a maximum number of 28 (256) host numbers."
"Suppose a class A address is 11.65.27.1, where 11 is a network prefix (address), and 65.27.1 specifies a particular host address on the network. Consider that a network admin wants to use 23 to 6 bits to identify the subnet and the remaining 5 to 0 bits to identify the host address. It can be represented in the Subnet mask with all 1 bits from 31 to 6 and the remaining (5 to 0) with 0 bits."
"Now, the subnet can be calculated by applying AND operation (1+1=1, 1+0=0, 0+1=0, 0+0=0) between complete IP address and Subnet mask. The result is:"
"All IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal addresses, written in 8 separate sections having each of them have 16 bits. As the IPv6 addresses are represented in a hexadecimal format, their sections range from 0 to FFFF. Each section is separated by colons (:). It also allows to removes the starting zeros (0) of each 16-bit section. If two or more consecutive sections 16-bit contains all zeros (0 : 0), they can be compressed using double colons (::)."
"IPv6 addresses are consist of 8 different sections, each section has a 16-bit hexadecimal values separated by colon (:). IPv6 addresses are represented as following format:"
"Each ""xxxx"" group contains a 16-bit hexadecimal value, and each ""x"" is a 4-bit hexadecimal value. For example:"
"You can also remove the starting zeros (0) of each 16-bit section. For example, the above IPv6 can be rewritten by omitting starting zeros (0) as follow:"
You can also compress the consecutive sections 16-bit zeros (0 : 0) using double colons (::). But keep in mind that you can do it only once per IP address.
"On the basis of ranges, IP addresses are categorized into five address classes which are given below."
"This article will discuss the differences between the bus and ring topology in detail. In the beginning, we will learn the meanings of bus and ring topology. After that, we will learn some of the differences between these two topologies."
"In a Bus topology, there is a single communication line or cable shared by all the nodes in the network by drop lines and taps, as shown in the following figure:"
"In the above figure, the drop line connects the nodes and the mainline, using a tap to add another device to the main cable. When one computer sends a signal up the cable, all the computers on the network receive the information. Still, the message is accepted by only that computer whose address is specified in the message's address field, and the rest of the nodes reject the message."
"In-ring topology, the various nodes are connected in the form of a ring or circle in which data flows in a circle, from one station to another station. It has no beginning or endpoint that needs to be terminated in the network. The following figure shows the working of ring topology."
Some ring networks in ring topology do token passing. Every computer in the ring receives the token in sequence. Each node in a ring topology has a repeater regenerates the bits and signal in a network when a particular device receives the signal intended for another device.
"This article will discuss the differences between the bus and star topology in detail. In the beginning, we will learn the meanings of bus and star topology. After that, we will learn some of the differences between these two topologies."
"In a Bus topology, there is a single communication line or cable shared by all the nodes in the network by drop lines and taps, as shown in the following figure:"
"In the above figure, the drop line connects the nodes and the mainline, using a tap to add another device to the main cable. When one computer sends a signal up the cable, all the computers on the network receive the information. Still, the message is accepted by only that computer whose address is specified in the message's address field, and the rest of the nodes reject the message."
"In star topology, there is a central controller called a hub. In this topology, each node in the network has a dedicated point-to-point link to this central controller device, also known as a hub. The following figure displays the working of star topology:"
"There is no direct link between the nodes in the above figure, and all these nodes communicate via a hub only."
"This article will learn the differences between circuit switching and packet switching. Both are types of switching techniques. Initially, we will learn some basics of switching network technologies. After that, we will see differences between both of them."
A circuit-switched network is one of the simplest data communication methods in which a dedicated path is established between the sending and receiving device. In this physical links connect via a set of switches.
In the above figure it shows a circuit switched network in which computer connect via 4 switches with a point to point connections.
"In the Packet switching Network, the message is divide into packets. Each packet contains a header which includes the source address, destination address, and control information."
"In the above figure, it shows how a data gram approach is used to deliver four packets from station A to station D."
"In this article will go through the difference between the star and ring topology in detail. In the beginning of this article, we will go through the basic meaning of both the topologies after that we will some differences between them."
"It is also called as star network. This topology has a client-server connection. In this, there is a central controller called a hub or switch. The following figure displays the working of star topology."
"In the above figure, it shows that all these nodes communicate via a hub only."
"It is also called as ring network. This topology has a peer to peer connection. In-ring topology, the various nodes are connected in the form of a ring in which data flows in a circle, from one station to another station. The following figure shows the working of ring topology."
"In the above figure, in a ring topology there is no master controller."
Following are the differences between the star topology and ring topology.
"In this article, we will learn the differences between Router and Bridge networking devices in detail."
"It is an interconnecting device that works at the physical, data link and network layer of OSI reference model. It may connect LAN and WAN in the network and can pass or relay the packets among them. It has access to the network or logical address. The following figure displays the router acts as a station in the network."
"In this the routers are a member of more than one network simultaneously. They have links with two or more networks and contain the addresses of the stations on all these networks. It receives the packets from one connected network and passes them to a second connected network. If a received packet contains the address of a node that is on some other network, the Router determines which of its connected networks the best next relay point for that packet."
"A bridge is a networking device that works in both the physical and data link layer in a network. This devices can divide a large network into smaller segments and pass the frames between two originally separated LANs. A bridge maintains a MAC address of various stations attached to it. When a frames enters a bridge, it checks the address contained in the frame and compares it with a table of all the stations on both segments."
"For Example, A-frame is sent from station A to station C. When this frame arrives at the Bridge, the Bridge checks its table and blocks it from crossing into the lower segment as station C is in the upper segment only. Thus, a frame is relayed to the entire upper segment and is not allowed to move to lower segment. If the frame is to be transmitted from station A to station F, the Bridge will allow this frame to pass through it and relay it to the entire lower segment."
"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transmission protocol that ensures data transmission in an ordered and secure manner. It sends and receives the data packets in the same order. TCP is a four-layer protocol compared to OSI (Open System Interconnection Model), which is a seven-layer transmission process. It is recommended to transmit data from high-level protocols due to its integrity and security between the server and client."
"TCP needs a 4-way handshake for its termination. To establish a connection, TCP needs a 3-way handshake. So, here we will discuss the detailed process of TCP to build a 3-way handshake for connection and a 4-way handshake for its termination. Here, we will discuss the following:"
"TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it first establishes the connection between the sender and receiver in the form of a handshake. After both the connections are verified, it begins transmitting packets. It makes the transmission process error-free and ensures the delivery of data. It is an important part of the communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. The whole internet system relies on this network."
"TCP is one of the most common protocols that ensure end-to-end delivery. It guarantees the security and integrity of the data being transmitted. It always establishes a secure connection between the sender and receiver. The transmitter is the server, and the receiver is known as the client. We can also say that the data transmission occurs between the server and client. Hence, TCP is used in most of the high-level protocols, such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mai Transfer Protocol)."
"The data is then divided into packets, assigned to the address, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination. The transmission process comprises four layers, application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and data link layer. The application layer performs the function similar to the top three layers (application, presentation, and session) of the OSI model and control user-interface specifications. The user interacts with the application layer of the TCP model, such as messaging and email systems. The transport layer provides a reliable and error-free data connection. It divides the data received from the application layer into packets, which helps in creating ordered sequence. The internet layer controls the routing of packet and ensures the delivery of a packet at the destination. The data link layer performs the function similar to the bottom two layers (data link and physical) of the OSI model. It is responsible for transmitting the data between the applications or devices in the network."
"Before proceeding towards the TCP termination, it is essential to understand the concept of TCP connection. It will help us to better understand the termination process."
"Handshake refers to the process to establish connection between the client and server. Handshake is simply defined as the process to establish a communication link. To transmit a packet, TCP needs a three way handshake before it starts sending data. The reliable communication in TCP is termed as PAR (Positive Acknowledgement Re-transmission). When a sender sends the data to the receiver, it requires a positive acknowledgement from the receiver confirming the arrival of data. If the acknowledgement has not reached the sender, it needs to resend that data. The positive acknowledgement from the receiver establishes a successful connection."
"Here, the server is the server and client is the receiver. The above diagram shows 3 steps for successful connection. A 3-way handshake is commonly known as SYN-SYN-ACK and requires both the client and server response to exchange the data. SYN means synchronize Sequence Number and ACK means acknowledgment. Each step is a type of handshake between the sender and the receiver."
The diagram of a successful TCP connection showing the three handshakes is shown below:
"SYN is a segment sent by the client to the server. It acts as a connection request between the client and server. It informs the server that the client wants to establish a connection. Synchronizing sequence numbers also helps synchronize sequence numbers sent between any two devices, where the same SYN segment asks for the sequence number with the connection request."
It is an SYN-ACK segment or an SYN + ACK segment sent by the server. The ACK segment informs the client that the server has received the connection request and it is ready to build the connection. The SYN segment informs the sequence number with which the server is ready to start with the segments.
ACK (Acknowledgment) is the last step before establishing a successful TCP connection between the client and server. The ACK segment is sent by the client as the response of the received ACK and SN from the server. It results in the establishment of a reliable data connection.
"After these three steps, the client and server are ready for the data communication process. TCP connection and termination are full-duplex, which means that the data can travel in both the directions simultaneously."
"Any device establishes a connection before proceeding with the termination. TCP requires 3-way handshake to establish a connection between the client and server before sending the data. Similarly, to terminate or stop the data transmission, it requires a 4-way handshake. The segments required for TCP termination are similar to the segments to build a TCP connection (ACK and SYN) except the FIN segment. The FIN segment specifies a termination request sent by one device to the other."
The client is the data transmitter and the server is a receiver in a data transmission process between the sender and receiver. Consider the below TCP termination diagram that shows the exchange of segments between the client and server.
The diagram of a successful TCP termination showing the four handshakes is shown below:
Let's discuss the TCP termination process with the help of six steps that includes the sent requests and the waiting states. The steps are as follows:
FIN refers to the termination request sent by the client to the server. The first FIN termination request is sent by the client to the server. It depicts the start of the termination process between the client and server.
The client waits for the ACK of the FIN termination request from the server. It is a waiting state for the client.
The server sends the ACK (Acknowledgement) segment when it receives the FIN termination request. It depicts that the server is ready to close and terminate the connection.
The client waits for the FIN segment from the server. It is a type of approved signal sent by the server that shows that the server is ready to terminate the connection.
The FIN segment is now sent by the server to the client. It is a confirmation signal that the server sends to the client. It depicts the successful approval for the termination.
"The client now sends the ACK (Acknowledgement) segment to the server that it has received the FIN signal, which is a signal from the server to terminate the connection. As soon as the server receives the ACK segment, it terminates the connection."
"Steganography is derived from two Greek words:'stegos,' which means 'to cover,' and 'grayfia,' which means 'writing,' thus translating to 'covered writing,' or 'hidden writing.' Steganography is a method of concealing sensitive information by embedding it in an audio, video, image, or text file. It is one of the techniques used to protect confidential or sensitive data from malicious attacks."
"Cryptography and steganography are both methods for concealing or protecting sensitive information. They differ in that cryptography makes the data unreadable or conceals the meaning of the data, whereas steganography conceals the existence of the data."
"Cryptography is analogous to writing a letter in a secret language: people can read it but won't understand what it means. The existence of a (likely secret) message, on the other hand, would be obvious to anyone who sees the letter, and if someone knows or figures out your secret language, your message can be easily read."
"If you used steganography in the same situation, you would conceal the letter inside a pair of socks that you would give to the intended recipient. To those who are unaware of the message, your gift appears to be nothing more than the socks. However, the intended recipient is aware of what to look for and discovers the message hidden within them."
Cryptography is frequently used to augment the security provided by steganography. Encryption algorithms are used to encrypt secret data before it is embedded in cover files.
"Image Steganography, as the name implies, is the process of concealing data within an image file. The image chosen for this purpose is referred to as the cover image, and the image obtained after steganography is referred to as the stego image."
"In memory, an image is represented as a N*M (for greyscale images) or N*M*3 (for colour images) matrix, with each entry representing the intensity value of a pixel. Image steganography embeds a message into an image by changing the values of some pixels chosen by an encryption algorithm."
"When steganography is used alone, it provides security through obscurity, which may result in the secret message being revealed. Combining steganography and cryptography is the most effective way to hide a message from adversaries while still protecting it if it is discovered."
"His steganography method involves hiding a large amount of data (image, audio, and text) within a colour bitmap (bmp) image. In his study, the image will be filtered and segmented, with bits replacement applied to the appropriate pixels. These pixels are chosen at random rather than in any particular order."
"The process of steganalysis is used to detect the message within the cover image. This can be accomplished by comparing the image to the cover image, plotting histograms, or detecting noise. While efforts are being made to develop new algorithms that are more resistant to such attacks, efforts are also being made to improve existing algorithms for steganalysis, which detects the exchange of secret information between terrorists or criminal elements."
"We've all heard the term ""Net Neutrality,"" but only a few of us are familiar with it. We expect to be connected to whatever website we want and to have access to whatever content we want when we go online. In other words, we expect our internet service provider to not tamper with the data and to connect us to all websites, applications, and content that we select."
"Mark Zuckerberg didn't need to ask any internet service providers to add Facebook to their networks when he created it. He also did not have to pay these companies any additional fees to ensure that Facebook worked as well as established companies' websites. Instead, as soon as he created the Facebook website, it became instantly accessible from any internet-connected computer on the planet."
"Net Neutrality, also known as Network Neutrality, is a key criterion that prevents internet service providers from interfering with or blocking any content or websites that we want to use. It means that ISPs should provide us with open networks and not block or discriminate against any applications that run on those networks. Our ISP should not interfere with the content we view or post online, just as our phone company should not decide who we call or what we say on that call."
"In the absence of Net Neutrality, internet service providers may divide the internet into fast and slow lanes. An ISP may slow down or even block the content of its competitors. Few content companies that can afford to pay for preferential treatment pay more to ISPs, forcing everyone else to use a slower layer of service, effectively destroying the open internet."
"Supporters argue that network neutrality has allowed for so much innovation on the internet over the last two decades, allowing the creation of dozens of innovative online services such as Google, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, Skype, and others. Network neutrality ensures that new websites and internet applications have equal opportunities to establish themselves in the user space."
"They are concerned that without net neutrality, the internet will become less welcoming to new businesses and innovative ideas. For example, if large ISPs start charging video streaming sites extra to deliver video content to customers, it may be difficult to negotiate deals with dozens of network owners for the next YouTube to gain traction."
"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved new and stronger network neutrality rules in February 2015, treating internet access as a public utility. Network neutrality supporters applauded the proposal, but opponents claim it will lead to excessive internet regulation. The regulations are also being challenged in court, with multiple telecom industry groups arguing that they exceed the FCC's authority."
"We should all support Network Neutrality because it treats all data on the Internet equally and does not discriminate or charge differently based on user, website, platform, or application. These principles prohibit internet service providers from interfering with speed or charging fees for specific websites and online content."
"Onion routing is a method of communicating anonymously over a computer network. Messages in an onion network are encapsulated in layers of encryption, similar to the layers of an onion."
"To make web browsing safer and more secure for users, there is a large set of precautionary measures and best practises. Assume you send an HTTPS request to a server and someone intercepts it, but that person cannot read the message because it is encrypted. However, you are not satisfied with this level of security and wish to take it to the next level, i.e. you do not want anyone sniffing on your network to know which server you are contacting and whether or not you are making any requests. This is where the onion routing comes into play."
"The Onion Routing programme is made up of studies that look into, design, build, and analyse anonymous communication networks. The emphasis is on practical solutions for low-latency Internet-based connections that can withstand traffic analysis, eavesdropping, and other attacks from both outsiders (like Internet routers) and insiders (like hackers) (Onion Routing servers themselves). The network only knows that communication is taking place because onion routing hides who is communicating with whom from the transport medium. Furthermore, the content of the conversation is hidden from eavesdroppers until the transmission leaves the OR network."
"When you browse the internet using a standard web browser such as Chrome or Firefox, you request webpages by sending simple GET requests to servers with no intermediary. It is only a single connection between a client and a server, and anyone sniffing on your network can determine which server your computer is contacting."
"This is done differently in onion routing. The connection is maintained between different nodes in onion routing, i.e. the connection hops from one server to another and when it reaches the last server on this circuit, it is the server that we wanted to contact and it will process our request and serve us the desired webpage, which is returned to us using the same network of nodes."
"You're probably wondering why it's called the onion router. It's because the messages we send and the responses we receive are encrypted with different keys, with each hop or server visit requiring a different key for encryption."
"The client has access to all keys, but the servers only have access to the keys that are specific to that server's encryption/decryption."
"Because this process wraps your message in layers of encryption that must be peeled off at each different hop, it is referred to as an onion router."
"Now imagine you are using Tor (the onion router), a unique browser that enables you to use the onion routers, to browse the internet. Since YouTube is blocked in China, you want to access YouTube but you also don't want your government to find out that you are doing so, so you choose to use Tor. To get the YouTube homepage, your computer must make contact with a specific server, but it does not do so directly. In order to prevent anyone from tracking the conversation you had with that server, it does this through three nodes/servers/routers (maintained by volunteers around the world) before that server. Although a real Tor network can have hundreds of nodes in between, I am only using 3 nodes in this example to keep things simple."
"The client encrypts the message (get request) three times, wrapping it in three layers like an onion that must be peeled one layer at a time. This client has access to keys 1, 2, and 3."
"This triple-encrypted message is then forwarded to Node 1, the first server (Input Node)."
"Only Node 2's address and Key 1 are stored in Node 1. It uses Key 1 to decrypt the message but realises that it is illogical because there are still two layers of encryption, so it sends the message to Node 2."
Key 2 and the addresses of the input and exit nodes are located on Node 2. It then transmits the message to the exit node after using Key 2 to decrypt it but realising that it is still encrypted.
"A GET request for youtube.com is discovered by Node 3 (the exit node), which removes the final layer of encryption and forwards it to the target server."
The requested webpage is delivered as a result of the server processing the request.
"The response travels backwards through the same nodes, each of which adds a layer of encryption using its unique key."
"In the end, it is delivered to the client as a triple encrypted response that can be decrypted because the client has access to all the keys."
"Imagine that a sniffer is present at the first connection (client - input node) and that all it can decipher is the address of the input node and an illogical message that has been triple encrypted. Therefore, the spy or attacker is aware that you are using Tor to browse."
"Similar to this, if sniffing begins at the exit node, all the sniffer sees is one server speaking to another, but it is unable to identify the client or the origin of the request."
"However, you might now imagine that if someone were to listen in at Node 2, they would be able to trace the client and the destination server if they knew the addresses of the input and exit. But it's not that easy; each of these nodes is running hundreds of connections simultaneously, making it difficult to determine which connection leads to the correct source and destination. Node 2 is a middle node in our circuit, but it can also be a part of another circuit on a different connection where it serves as an exit node dispensing websites from various servers or an input node receiving requests."
"The only security hole in onion routing is that if someone is watching a server at the same time and compares a request made by a client on the other side of the network to a request made by a server at the destination by analysing the length and frequency of the characters found in the intercepted request or response at the destination server and using that to match with the same request made by a client in a split second (time-stamps on requests and responses can also be used as a substitute for Even though it's challenging, it's not impossible. However, fixing this flaw in Tor is essentially impossible."
A firewall is a type of network security system that responds to incoming or outgoing packets according to preset rules based on their IP address and port number. Adaptive Security Appliance is what Cisco calls its firewall (ASA).
"There are a number of models in the Cisco ASA 5500 series, including the Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5515-X, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5525-X, Cisco ASA 5540, Cisco ASA 5550, Cisco ASA 5555-X, and Cisco ASA 5585-X."
"Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a Cisco security product that combines basic firewall functionality with VPN support, antivirus protection, and a number of other features. The following are some ASA features:"
Packet filtering: It is the straightforward process of filtering an incoming or outgoing packet based on the rules set forth in the ACL that has been configured for the device. It includes a number of allowable or prohibited conditions. No other rule is matched and the matched rule is executed if the traffic satisfies one of the rules.
"Stateful filtering: If a packet is generated from a higher security level to a lower security level by default, ASA performs stateful tracking of the packet. TCP and UDP reply traffic will by default be allowed and will be able to, for example, telnet the other device in Lower security level if the traffic is initiated by the devices in Higher security levels for lower security levels device (as destination). This is due to stateful inspection being enabled by default, which maintains a stateful database (in which an entry about the source and destination device information such as IP address, port numbers are maintained)."
"Routing support -Static routing, default routing, and dynamic routing protocols like EIGRP, OSPF, and RIP are all supported by the ASA."
"ASA's transparent firewall has two modes of operation:

Routed mode: In this mode, the ASA functions as a layer 3 device (router hop) and requires that its interface have two distinct IP addresses, which translates to two distinct subnets.
Transparent mode: In this mode, ASA operates at layer 2 and requires only a single IP address to manage ASA-related tasks because both the internal and external interfaces serve as a bridge."
"Routed mode: In this mode, the ASA functions as a layer 3 device (router hop) and requires that its interface have two distinct IP addresses, which translates to two distinct subnets."
"Transparent mode: In this mode, ASA operates at layer 2 and requires only a single IP address to manage ASA-related tasks because both the internal and external interfaces serve as a bridge."
Support for AAA services is provided by ASA either through a local database or a third-party server like ACS (Access Control Server).
VPN support - ASA supports SSL-based and policy-based VPNs such as point-to-point IPsec VPNs (including site-to-site VPN and remote access VPNs).
IPv6 support - ASA (new versions) supports static and dynamic IPv6 routing.
VPN load balancing is a Cisco ASA feature that is proprietary to Cisco. A number of ASA units can simultaneously share a number of clients.
"Stateful failover - ASA supports a pair of Cisco ASA devices for high availability. The other ASA device will continue operating normally even if one of the ASA fails. When stateful failover is enabled, the active unit continuously transmits backup device connection state data. The new active unit has access to the same connection information following the failover."
"With Cisco ASA's clustering feature, we can set up multiple ASA devices as a single logical device. There can be a maximum of 8 cohesive units in the cluster. High throughput and redundancy are both produced as a result of this."
Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) - Cisco ASA supports Next-Generation firewall features that can provide advanced malware protection in a single device by combining traditional firewall features with NGFW features.
"MPF, or the Modular Policy Framework, is used to specify policies for various traffic flows. In order to use advanced firewall features like QoS, Policing, prioritising, etc., it is used in ASA.
In order to use MPF, we define the Class-map to identify the type of traffic, the Policy-map to determine what actions, such as prioritising, should be taken, and the Service-Policy to determine where they should be used."
The relabel-to-front algorithm is employed to determine the network's maximum flow. The generic push-relabel approach is less effective than the relabel-to-front algorithm. The basic operations of push and relabel can be used in any order when using the push-relabel method. The relabel-to-front algorithm carefully selects the order and effectively controls the network data structures.
"First, we must comprehend the fundamental operations, such as push and relabel:"
The height variable (h) and excess flow are the 2 variables that are connected to each vertex in the network (e).
"Push: When a vertex has excess flow and an adjacent node in the residual graph has a lower height, we push the flow from the vertex to the node with the lower height."
"Relabel: When a vertex has too much flow and there are no nodes nearby that are lower in height, we use the relabel operation to make the vertex taller so that it can perform push operations."
"The relabel-to-front algorithm keeps track of the network's vertices in a list. It repeatedly chooses an overflowing vertex u and executes a discharge operation on it, starting at the very beginning of the list."
Push and relabel operations are carried out during discharge operations up until vertex u has no positive excess flow (e)
"In the event that a vertex is relabeled, the algorithm scans once more with the new vertex at the front of the list."
Set the preflow and heights to their respective initial values for the aforementioned generic push-relabel algorithm.
"Create list L from scratch, leaving out the sources and sinks."
Set each vertex's current pointer to the first vertex in its neighbour list N. Those vertices for which a residual edgeexists are included in the neighbour list N.
Perform the discharge operation on the vertex u after choosing it from list L.
Put you at the top of the list if you were relabeled due to discharge.
The vertex in the following iteration is the one that follows u in its new position in the list if u was moved to the front of the list.
"Consider the flow network as an example. The initial list L=(B, C) with initial value u=B is displayed on the right."
following the initialization of the preflow. A neighbour list N with the current neighbour circled is located under each vertex in list L.
"Since Vertex B has an excess flow of 3 (e=3), a discharge operation is performed. Vertex B performs a relabel operation (h=1) and pushes flow 1 to vertex C because it lacks a node with a lower height."
"Vertex B performs a relabel operation (h=5) and pushes flow 2 to vertex A because it still has extra flow 2(e=2). Vertex B remains at the top of the list despite having its label changed. Now that vertex C has an excess flow of 1(e=1), it is discharged."
"Relabel operation (h=1) is carried out by vertex C, and flow 1 is pushed to node D. Vertex C is moved to the top of the list because it performed a relabel operation."
"Now, in L, vertex B follows vertex C, but B does not have an excess flow. Once it reaches theend of list L, the RELABEL-TO-FRONT comes to an end. Since there are no overflowing vertices, the preflow is at its highest level. Here, maximum flow is 1."
"Time Complexity: On network G, runs in O(V3) time (V, E). As a result, it performs better than the generic push-relabel algorithm, which takes O(V2E) time to complete."
"The division of a physical server into a number of tiny virtual servers, each running a different operating system, is known as server virtualization. They are referred to as ""guest operating systems."" These are operating on a different OS, referred to as the host OS. In this setup, no other guests on the same host are aware of the existence of the other guests. To achieve this transparency, various virtualization techniques are used."
"Between the operating system and the hardware, there is a layer known as a hypervisor or VMM (virtual machine monitor). It offers the features and services required for the efficient operation of several operating systems."
"In addition to handling the queuing, dispatching, and returning of the hardware requests, it recognises traps and responds to privileged CPU instructions. The hypervisor is topped by a host operating system that controls and manages the virtual machines."
"The foundation is Hypervisor. This model takes care of a large portion of the emulation and trapping overhead in software implemented virtualization. Earlier than being installed into the virtual machine, the guest operating system is modified and recompiled."
Performance is improved as a result of the modified guest operating system's direct communication with the hypervisor and the elimination of emulation overhead.
"Example: To support the administrative environment known as domain 0, which is used by Xen primarily, a tailored Linux environment is used."
"It and paravirtualization are very similar. When necessary, it can simulate the underlying hardware. The operating system's machine operations for I/O and changing the status of the system are captured by the hypervisor. After trapping, these operations are software-emulated, and the status codes that are returned are remarkably similar to what real hardware would produce. Because of this, an unaltered operating system can function on top of the hypervisor."
"This approach is used, for instance, by VMWare ESX server. As the administrative operating system, Service Console is a modified version of Linux. Compared to Paravirtualization, it is slower."
"In terms of functionality, it is comparable to Full Virtualization and Paravirtualization, with the exception that it needs hardware support. By relying on the hardware extensions of the x86 architecture, a large portion of the hypervisor overhead caused by trapping and simulating I/O operations and status instructions executed within a guest OS is dealt with."
"Unmodified OS can be used to handle hardware access requests, privileged and protected operations, and communication with the virtual machine as the hardware support for virtualization would be used."
Examples of hardware that supports virtualization include AMD's V Pacifica and Intel's VT Vanderpool.
"It runs a different Linux kernel and sees the associated virtual machine as a user-space process on the physical host rather than using a hypervisor. As a result, managing multiple virtual machines on a single host is simple. For communication between the virtual machine and the main Linux kernel, a device driver is utilised."
Virtualization requires processor support (Intel VT or AMD - v). The display and execution containers for the virtual machines are modified versions of the QEMU process. Kernel-level virtualization resembles server virtualization in many ways.
Examples include Kernel Virtual Machine and User-Mode Linux (UML) ( KVM )
"utilises a single instance of the operating system kernel to run multiple, logically separate environments. Also known as the ""shared kernel approach"" because the host operating system kernel is shared by all virtual machines. based on the ""chroot"" change root concept."
"During boot, chroot begins. Root filesystems are used by the kernel to load drivers and carry out other early system initialization tasks. The system continues system initialization and configuration within that file system after switching to a different root filesystem using the chroot command to mount an on-disk file system as its final root filesystem."
"This idea is expanded upon by the chroot mechanism of system-level virtualization. By doing so, the system is able to launch virtual servers with independent sets of processes that run in relation to their own filesystem root directories."
"The ability to run different operating systems on different virtual systems is the primary distinction between system-level and server virtualization. Server virtualization is when different servers can have different operating systems, including different versions of the same operating system, as opposed to system-level virtualization, which requires all virtual servers to share the same copy of the operating system."
a great deal lighter than full machines (including a kernel)
An operating system virtualization typically involves little to no overhead.
"Additionally, it can make use of dynamic load balancing of containers between nodes and clusters."
"The file-level copy-on-write (CoW) technique is possible with OS virtualization, and it is more space-efficient, easier to cache, and easier to back up data than block-level copy-on-write schemes."
All virtual servers could be brought to a halt by kernel or driver issues.
"ACLs are a set of rules for regulating network traffic and minimising network attacks. Using a set of rules specified for the network's incoming or outgoing traffic, ACLs are used to filter traffic."
"The defined set of rules is matched line by line, starting with the first line, then the second, then the third, and so on."
"Only up until the rule matches are the packets matched. No further comparisons are made after a rule matches, and that rule is then applied."
"Every ACL has an implicit denial at the end, meaning that the packet will be discarded if neither a condition nor a rule is met."
The access-list should then be applied to the interface's inbound or outbound traffic once it has been constructed:
"Inbound access lists - When an access list is applied to an interface's inbound packets, the inbound packets are first processed in accordance with the access list before being forwarded to the outbound interface."
"Outbound access lists - When an access list is applied to an interface's outbound packet header, the outbound interface will first route the packet before processing it."
"There are two main types of access-list, and they are as follows:"
"Standard Access-list : These Access-lists are created solely using the source IP address. These ACLs either allow or disallow the entire set of protocols. TCP, UDP, HTTPS, and other types of IP traffic are not differentiated. The router will recognise it as a standard ACL and the specified address as the source IP address if you use the numbers 1-99 or 1300-1999."
"Long Access List : The ACL that makes use of source IP, destination IP, source port, and destination port is this one. We can also specify which IP traffic should be permitted or blocked using these ACLs. These employ the 100-199 and 2000-2699 ranges. The process on the client machine sends the clock server a request at time T 0 for the clock time (time at the server)."
"Numbered access lists are access lists that, once created, cannot be specifically deleted; for example, if we want to remove any rules from an access list, this is not allowed in the case of a numbered access list. The access list as a whole will be deleted if we attempt to remove a rule from it. Both standard and extended access lists can use the numbered access-list."
"Named access list: In this type of access list, a name is given to the access list in order to identify it. Unlike numbered access lists, named access lists can be deleted. These can be used with both standards and extended access lists, just like numbered access lists."
"In general, the standard Access-list is used close to the destination ( but not always )."
"Typically, the extended Access-list is used close to the source (but not always)."
"We are only allowed to assign one ACL per interface, per protocol, and per direction, meaning that each interface can only have one inbound and one outbound ACL."
"If we are using a numbered Access-list, we are unable to remove a rule from it. The entire ACL will be removed if we attempt to remove a rule. A specific rule can be deleted if named access lists are being used."
"Before implementing the access lists, carefully analyse the entire scenario because every new rule that is added will be placed at the bottom of the access list."
"Every access list has an implicit denial at the end, so we need to have at least a permit statement there; otherwise, all traffic will be blocked."
Extended access lists cannot share the same name as standard access lists.
Security is provided because the administrator can customise the access list to meet specific requirements and prevent malicious packets from entering the network.
provides control over the traffic by allowing or disallowing it based on the requirements of the network.
"A communication medium called Digital Subscriber Line (DSL; formerly known as Digital Subscriber Loop) is used to transmit internet traffic over copper wire telecommunications lines. DSL is one of the most widely used methods by which ISPs offer broadband internet access, along with cable internet."
Its goal is to keep the data transfer speed at a high level.
"If you're wondering how we'll be able to have both telephone and internet access, the answer is by using splitters or DSL filters (shown in the below diagram). The splitter basically divides the frequency and ensures that they cannot be interrupted."
"Equal download and upload speeds are provided by symmetric DSL (SDSL), which evenly divides the upstream and downstream frequencies. 2 Mbps may be available both upstream and downstream on this connection. Small businesses typically prefer it."
"The wider frequency range offered by asymmetric DSL (ADSL) allows for several times faster downstream speeds. Due to the fact that most users download more data than they upload, an ADSL connection may provide 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream."
"No Additional Wiring: Since a DSL connection uses your existing telephone wiring, you won't need to invest in pricey phone system upgrades."
Cost-Effective - DSL internet offers the best connectivity and is a very cost-effective method.
Users are able to use the internet and telephone lines simultaneously. And the reason for that is that voice and digital signals use different frequencies to be transmitted.
Users can select from a range of providers' prices and connection speeds.
"Only a small physical distance can be covered by DSL Internet service, and it is frequently not available in places where the local phone infrastructure does not support DSL. Not every location can access the service. When compared to sending data over the Internet, the connection is quicker when receiving data."
Using an operating system A feature of an operating system known as virtualization allows for the existence of numerous separate user-space instances. Operating system-based virtualization is also referred to as virtualization during software installation. The host operating system is the one that it is installed over once it has already been running.
"In this form of virtualization, the user instals the virtualization software on his computer's operating system in the same way that he would any other programme, then makes use of the programme to run and create various virtual machines. Here, the user has direct access to any of the built-in virtual machines thanks to the virtualization software. Operating system virtualization may have an impact on hardware compatibility issues even when the hardware driver is not allotted to the virtualization software, as the host OS can provide hardware devices with the necessary support."
Hardware IT resources that need specialised software to operate can be transformed into virtualized IT resources using virtualization software. Many OS-based services are available as organisational management and administration tools that can be used for the virtualization host management because the host OS is an entire operating system in and of itself.
The following list of important operating system-based services is provided:
The following is a description of the principal operations of operating system-based virtualization:
It is possible to use hardware features like the CPU and network connection.
"peripherals that are connected and can be used, like a webcam, printer, keyboard, or scanners."
"Depending on the request made by the programme and the user account under which it is running, the operating system may be able to grant or deny access to these resources. These resources may also be hidden by the OS, which means that when they are computed by a computer programme, they are not included in the results of the enumeration. However, from the perspective of programming, the computer programme has engaged with those resources, and the operating system has controlled an action of engagement."
"It is possible to run programmes inside containers with operating-system virtualization or containerization, to which only a portion of these resources are allocated. Once running inside a container, a programme that is meant to understand the entire computer is limited to what it can see and assumes are the only resources available. Each operating system supports the formation of a number of containers, to each of which a portion of the computer's resources are allotted. Many computer programmes might be present in each container. These programmes might operate separately or concurrently, or even interact."
"Operating system-based virtualization may result in increased requirements and issues with performance overhead, including:"
"The host operating system makes use of hardware IT resources like CPU, memory, and other."
"Calls from guest operating systems to the hardware must pass through many layers in order to reach it, which reduces performance."
"Along with separate licences for each of their guest operating systems, licences are frequently required for host operating systems."
Access-lists (ACL) have recently been used for packet filtering and protection. ACL operates using the administrator's list of rules in order. The regulations include a number of permit and deny requirements. The only drawback of ACL is that it only filters traffic at the transport layer.
"Therefore, a Cisco router with the appropriate IOS version is used for low-cost firewall functionality. There are two ways to implement an IOS-based firewall:"
"In contrast to how ACLs protect and filter traffic at the transport layer, CBAC extends that protection to the application layer. The router can function as a firewall with CBAC configuration."
"While CBAC only functions as a reflexive Access-list, it also keeps a state table where the sessions are stored in memory. A dynamic entry is added to the state table and outbound (going out) traffic is permitted to pass through the router when a session is started by a device within the network (IoS based firewall). As the router (an IoS-based firewall) has an entry for traffic initiated within the network, it can pass the reply of outbound traffic with the aid of this entry. The IoS-based firewall CBAC mechanism accomplishes this by temporarily opening gaps in the access list (applied to the inbound traffic) to let reply packets through."
"ACLs are a set of rules for regulating network traffic and minimising network attacks. Using a set of rules specified for the network's incoming or outgoing traffic, ACLs are used to filter traffic."
Examining traffic: CBAC keeps track of the TCP/UDP information required for more thorough packet payload inspection.
Traffic filtering: CBAC only permits replies if they have an entry in the state table. It filters traffic that originates from trusted networks and leaves the firewall. It is capable of layer 7 intelligent traffic filtering.
"Intrusion detection: To identify attacks like Dos attacks and TCP syn attacks, the CBAC looks at the speed at which the connection was established. Based on this, the CBAC mechanism has the ability to either drop or reestablish a connection in response to malicious packets."
"Creating alerts and audits: The router's CBAC mechanism records data about connections made, the amount of data sent, and the IP addresses of the source and destination."
"There are three routers: router1 (10.1.1.1/24 on fa0/0), router2 (10.1.1.2/24 on fa0/0 and 10.1.2.1/24 on fa0/1) and router3 (10.1.2.2/24). To enable pinging between routers, we will first assign routes via EIGRP to every router."
"Following that, we will configure router 3 as an ssh server, and router 2 (on which CBAC will be running) will only permit traffic after it has been examined by router 2."
"Next, set up EIGRP on router 2 to connect to other networks:"
"On router 2, we will now create an Access-list through which we will block all traffic aside from EIGRP because EIGRP ensures that all routers can still communicate with one another."
"Now that we have applied access-list, which will only accept Eigrp packets and deny all other packets, router1 will no longer be able to ssh router3."
"Now, set up CBAC on router 2 to examine ssh traffic (Only traffic that will be examined by the IoS router operating CBAC will be permitted.)"
"While the second command will examine the ssh traffic, the first command (!cbac) will enable the cbac feature."
"Now that the ssh packet has been examined by router2 before leaving the outbound (fa0/1) interface, router1 will be able to ssh router3 (as we have configured)."
"Because it requires in-depth knowledge of the protocols and operations we want to carry out, CBAC is not easy to understand."
The CBAC mechanism is unable to inspect traffic that originates from the router (on which CBAC has been configured).
"No support for stateful table fail over. As a CBAC firewall, another redundant router can be used if one fails, but because the state table cannot be duplicated, it must be rebuilt, which requires rebuilding some connections."
"Client processes synchronise time with a time server using Cristian's Algorithm, a clock synchronisation algorithm. While redundancy-prone distributed systems and applications do not work well with this algorithm, low-latency networks where round trip time is short relative to accuracy do. The time interval between the beginning of a Request and the conclusion of the corresponding Response is referred to as Round Trip Time in this context."
An example mimicking the operation of Cristian's algorithm is provided below:
The process on the client machine sends the clock server a request at time T 0 for the clock time (time at the server).
"In response to the client process's request, the clock server listens and responds with clock server time."
The client process retrieves the response from the clock server at time T1 and uses the formula below to determine the synchronised client clock time.
"where TCLIENT denotes the synchronised clock time, TSERVER denotes the clock time returned by the server, T0 denotes the time at which the client process sent the request, and T1 denotes the time at which the client process received the response"
"Assuming that the network latency T0 and T1 are roughly equal, T1 - T0 denotes the total amount of time required by the network and server to transfer the request to the server, process it, and return the result to the client process."
The difference between client-side and real-time time is no more than (T1 - T0)/2 seconds. We can infer from the aforementioned statement that the synchronisation error can only be (T1 - T0)/2 seconds at most.
"Error E [-(T 1 - T 0)/2, (T 1 - T 0)/2]"
"To start a clock server prototype on a local machine, enter the following code:"
"On the local machine, the following code runs a client process prototype:"
We can define a minimum transfer time that we can use to create an improved synchronisation clock time through iterative testing over the network (less synchronisation error).
"The server time will always be generated after T0 + T min in this case, and TSERVER will always be generated before T1 - Tmin, where T min is the minimum transfer time, which is the minimum value of TREQUEST and TRESPONSE during several iterative tests. Here, a formulation of the synchronisation error is as follows:"
"Similar to this, if TREQUEST and TRESPONSE differ by a significant amount of time, TMIN1 and TMIN2 may be used in place of TMIN1 and TMIN2, respectively, where TMIN1 denotes the minimum observed request time and TMIN2 denotes the minimum observed response time over the network."
"In this scenario, the synchronised clock time can be calculated as follows:"
(T1 - T0)/2 + (Tmin2 - Tmin1)/2 +TSERVER = TCLIENT
"Therefore, we can improve clock time synchronisation and subsequently reduce the overall synchronisation error by simply introducing response and request time as separate time latencies. The total clock drift that is seen will determine how many iterative tests need to be performed."
"The primary name for an 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN), which includes both home networks and public hotspots, is Service Set Identifier (SSID). This name is used by client devices to identify themselves and join wireless networks. For instance, while attempting to connect to a wireless network at work or school with the name guest network, you notice there are several others in the area with completely different names. The SSIDs for those networks are all the names you can see. A broadband router or broadband modem stores the SSID on home Wi-Fi networks, but administrators can modify it. This name is broadcast by routers to aid wireless clients in locating the network."
"The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a case-sensitive text string with a maximum length of 32 characters that can be made up of either letters, numbers, or both. The SSID is completely unrestricted by these guidelines. Manufacturers of routers pre-program the Wi-Fi unit with a default SSID, such as TP LINK, D LINK, JIO FI, or simply DEFAULT. Not all wireless networks have a standardised name like that because the SSID can be modified."
"Mobile phones, laptops, and other wireless devices search the neighbourhood for networks broadcasting their SSIDs and display a list of names. By selecting a name from the list, a user can connect to a fresh network connection. The device typically indicates a secured network by placing a lock symbol next to the SSID."
"The majority of wireless devices record the various networks a user joins as well as their preferred connection settings. Additionally, users can configure a device to join networks with specific SSIDs automatically by saving that setting in their profiles. To put it another way, after you connect, the device typically asks if you want to save the network and reconnect automatically later."
"Since it essentially necessitates that clients know two passwords-the SSID and the network password-most wireless routers provide the option to disable SSID broadcasting in order to increase Wi-Fi network security. The effectiveness of this method is constrained, though, because it's simple to extract the SSID from the header of data packets passing through the router. The user must manually create a profile with the name and other connection details in order to connect to networks with disabled SSID broadcast."
"If a network's wireless security features are not enabled, anyone can connect to it by simply knowing the SSID."
"The likelihood that another nearby network will share the same name increases when a default SSID is used, which may cause wireless clients to become confused. A Wi-Fi device will prefer and possibly attempt to automatically connect to the stronger radio signal when it finds two networks with the same name, even though this may not be the desired option. The worst-case scenario is that a person could be disconnected from their own home network and reconnected to a neighbor's who has login protection disabled."
"Only general and sensible information should be included in the SSID chosen for a home network. Some names, such as HackMyWIFIIfYouCan, unnecessarily incite burglars to prioritise some homes and networks over others."
An SSID may contain coded messages or language that is offensive to the public.
"Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using a broadband Internet connection rather than an analogue (traditional) phone line. Some VoIP services allow you to call multiple people at the same time, while others may allow you to call anyone. They can have or not have a phone number, which includes local, long-distance, mobile, and international numbers. Some VoIP services require you to use your computer or a special VoIP phone, whereas others allow you to use a regular phone connected to a VoIP adapter."
"VoIP services that travel over the Internet convert voice into a digital signal. When a regular phone number is dialled, the signal is converted to a regular telephone signal, i.e. an analogue signal, before reaching its destination. VoIP allows you to make a call directly from a computer equipped with a VoIP phone or from a traditional phone connected to a special adapter. Wireless hot spots in places like airports, hospitals, and cafes allow you to connect to the Internet and use VoIP services wirelessly."
"A high-speed Internet connection, such as a cable modem or high-speed services such as a local area network, is required. It is necessary to have a computer, adaptor, or specialised phone. Some VoIP services are only available through your computer or a special VoIP phone. Other services enable you to use a traditional phone in conjunction with a VoIP adapter. Some software and an inexpensive microphone are required if you use your computer. VoIP phones connect to your broadband connection and function similarly to traditional phones. If you use a VoIP adapter on your phone, you can dial as usual, and the service provider may also provide a dial tone."
"Your landline phones are plugged into a phone jack when using an analogue phone system. Calls are placed over the public switched telephone network, and sound is transmitted via electrical pulses sent through copper wires."
"If your company still uses landlines, you probably have a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system installed on-site. You don't need multiple phone lines when using a PBX because your phone provider will set up an internal phone network that effectively connects your employees on a shared phone system."
"When using a VoIP phone system, call information is transmitted online. You can make phone calls using your current internet connection. It is not necessary for your employees to be calling from a landline phone plugged into an electrical outlet and connected to trenched and laid wires in order to make and receive phone calls; they can do so from anywhere they have access to the internet."
"Additionally, internet-based phone systems are more dependable. Voice data is sent more quickly during calls because it uses the internet. Long-distance calls also don't come with any concerns about call quality issues or additional costs. Additionally, since your provider is in charge of managing and maintaining the hardware, software, and network, you won't need internal IT resources to make sure your phone system runs smoothly."
"VoIP phones are built to transmit calls using IP technologies. Despite having all the same features as a business phone, such as conference calling, do not disturb, and call waiting, they are wireless phones that don't require an outlet connection like a landline phone would."
"If they perform remote work, your employees can use these phones both at the office and at home. They require no lengthy setup procedures, so you can use them right away."
A headset is an additional piece of VoIP equipment that is optional. Employees can converse comfortably without holding up a phone or using their computer's audio if they have a headset.
"No, you don't need to buy a new modem or router for your company. You can make and receive calls from your device once your VoIP application has been downloaded there. However, if the internet connection for your company isn't strong enough, you might want to think about upgrading to make sure you have enough bandwidth."
"You can continue to use your current on-site business phone system while taking advantage of the flexibility, call quality, and cost savings provided by internet-based calls with SIP Trunking. Businesses that use SIP Trunking to update their phone system can reduce costs by up to 50%."
"Calls are routed using this technology over the internet rather than traditional copper wires. You won't need to deal with a conventional phone company as a result. You won't require any additional hardware if your phone system is SIP Trunking compatible. If your phone system is more than ten years old, you might require a VoIP Gateway, a special gadget that converts analogue and digital calls into VoIP calls."
Some VoIP services provide features and services that are not available with a traditional phone or are only available for a fee.
It is possible to avoid paying for both a broadband connection and a traditional phone line.
"Some VoIP services do not function during power outages, and the service provider may or may not provide backup power."
Not all VoIP services connect to emergency services directly via emergency service numbers.
VoIP service providers may or may not provide directory assistance.
The most popular method for authenticating operations is the Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (CRAM). They are a collection of protocols in which one side issues a challenge (to be addressed) and the other side is required to respond with the right response (to be verified/checked) in order to be authenticated.
"As the name implies, static questions take a static approach to the challenge choice. The user can choose his challenge and confirm his identity. Consider the FORGET PASSWORD function in email services as an illustration. The ""security question"" that you have saved as part of the account setup is a static challenge. It is not anticipated that the right response to those questions would alter over time."
"Dynamic questions use a dynamic selection and authentication process for the Challenge. The tasks are chosen at random with the assumption that since the user is the genuine one, they will know the correct response."
The Fully Automated Public Turing Test to Distinguish Between Computers and People Spam and the automatic creation of new accounts on websites or for email are both stopped by CAPTCHA.
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables the secure operation of network services over insecure networks.
"The password is transmitted to the server, where it is checked by comparison with the right password."
4. A variation of CRAM called Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM):
"To ensure that the password is only used once, the challenge is hashed and salted. Instead than matching the plain text password itself, the server compares the hash against the hash of the correct password. Because the password may only be used once, it cannot be divulged, preventing Man-in-the-Middle and replay attacks."
"Every time a user wishes to verify himself, he must provide his unique biometric information (such as a retina scan or fingerprint scan) to the authenticating system for verification."
"A challenge-response barrier is a security measure used to keep assets safe from unauthorised users, activities, programmes, and internet of things (IoT) devices. It requires cyber attackers to complete a series of challenges in order to bypass the security barrier and gain access to additional materials. A commercial bank, for example, creates a multifactor authentication (MFA) process using challenge-response authentication. Using multiple CRAMs, this process authenticates a user's identity."
"A two-factor authentication (2FA) process might entail entering a password and receiving a code via email. An MFA variant may also ask a personal question, such as ""What is your mother's maiden name?"" However, account logins aren't the only use of challenge-response authentication."
"The user is shown an image, which is typically difficult to read at first look, and is then requested to input by deciphering the characters in the image. To stop bots from accessing the system, the input is then compared with the actual characters."
"An image is cut up and confused before being submitted to the user for some form of human user-verifiable authentication. The input is used to validate user input. The user's response and the answer provided by the ML model are compared. The ""task"" is to choose the correct parts from the jumbled-up image. in Google CAPTCHA authentication frequently observed."
"The proper password, which is already saved on the server you are attempting to access, is compared (directly or indirectly) with the one you entered to see if they match."
"One fundamental issue with passwords is that they are used repeatedly. When a password is received by the server, the server cannot determine whether or not the password is being entered by the real user."
Newer CRAMs also use cryptography to match the hash of the passwords rather than the plain passwords.
SCRAM is an abbreviation for Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism.
"The term ""access-list"" refers to a set of rules for controlling network traffic and reducing network attacks. ACLs are used to filter network traffic based on a set of rules defined for incoming or outgoing traffic."
"This is one of the most commonly used types of access-list because it can distinguish IP traffic, so the entire traffic will not be permitted or denied as in a standard access-list. These are the ACLs that distinguish IP traffic by using both source and destination IP addresses as well as port numbers. We can also specify which IP traffic should be allowed or denied in this type of ACL. These ranges are 100-199 and 2000-2699"
"Extended access-list is typically used close to the source, but this is not always the case."
"Packet filtering occurs in the Extended access list based on source IP address, destination IP address, and port numbers."
Specific services will be permitted or denied in an extended access list.
"The extended ACL range is 100 - 199, and the extended range is 2000 - 2699."
"Remember rules cannot be deleted if they are numbered with an extended Access-list. If one of the rules is removed, the entire access list is removed."
We have the ability to delete a rule from the access list if it is named with extended Access-list.
"Here is a simple organisational structure with three departments: sales, finance, and marketing. The networks for the marketing department are 172.16.60.0/24, the finance department is 172.16.50.0/24, and the sales department is 172.16.10.40/24. Now, we want to prevent the sales department from connecting through FTP to the finance department and the marketing and sales departments from telneting the finance department."
"First, set up a numbered extended access list to block FTP connections from the sales department to the finance department."
"Here, we first build a numbered Access-list and utilise 110 (taken from the extended access-list range) to deny the sales network's request to connect through FTP to the finance network (172.16.40.0). (172.16.50.0)."
"Note that TCP and port number 21 are used here since FTP. Therefore, depending on the situation, we must either specify the permit or reject the condition. Additionally, we must utilise the supplied application layer protocol's port number after eq."
"Now, we must prevent the sales and marketing departments from connecting via telnet to the finance department, therefore nobody should do so. setting up for the same."
"Here, the phrase any denotes any IP address from any subnet mask, or 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0. We must mention port number 23 after eq since telnet uses port number 23."
"This is the crucial thing right now. As we are previously aware, every access list has an implicit refuse at the end, meaning that if the traffic does not comply with any of the rules of the access-list, the traffic will be discarded."
Any traffic from a source with any IP address that complies with the aforementioned requirements will not enter the finance department via the specified method. We must now apply the access-list to the router's interface:
"As we recall, the extended access-list must be applied as close to the source as possible, but in this case, we applied it too close to the destination because we need to block traffic from both the sales and marketing departments; as a result, we must apply the extended access-list close to the destination otherwise we will need to create separate access-lists for fa0/0 and fa1/0 inbound."
Now we will create a named extended access list while keeping the same topology in mind.
By using this command we have made an access-list named blockacl.
"After that, we repeat the settings we did for the numbered access-list."
"There are two different technologies that are used to send and receive data wirelessly: Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) and Li-Fi (light fidelity). While Li-Fi uses LED lights and light signals to transmit and receive data, Wi-Fi uses routers and radio frequency (RF) waves to do so."
The following are the key distinctions between LiFi and WiFi:
"Because of the use of VLC technology and highly effective LED bulbs, the price is low."
increased transmission speed due to the rapid movement of light.
"less interference, the ability to cross salt water, and the capacity to function in densely populated areas."
prevents unauthorised access due to the opaque walls' ability to block out visible light.
"WiFi did away with the need for direct physical connections to servers, allowing users to access local networks and the internet without them. The fact that WiFi connections are wireless means that users can access them from anywhere in the vicinity."
Simple to implement because all you need to do is contact an ISP to get an internet connection and a WiFi router to get an access point.
"Since LiFi technology is still a new idea, there is essentially no infrastructure needed to implement it on a large enough scale."
The light source must always be on in order to enable network access.
It becomes incredibly susceptible to interference from outside sources because it transmits data using light.
"Because of the limited signal range emitted by light bulbs when using LiFi devices, users are forced to remain stationary."
WiFi networks are well-known for being unsafe. Its broad signal range is primarily responsible for its lack of security.
"There is more interference, it can't cross salt water, and it prefers less populated areas."
"Signals are incredibly erratic. This is because there are still a lot of external interferences that can affect radio frequencies. Weak signals, poor reception, and even connection loss can happen as a result of the wide variety of connection problems."
"An access-list by default doesn't record the sessions. The many permit and deny rules that make up an access list are read from top to bottom. No additional condition is met if any of the criteria are met, hence it is executed."
A reflexive Access-list serves as a stateful firewall for a very small workplace by only allowing traffic that is initiated within the network while blocking other packets coming from the outside.
Reflexive Access-list is an access-list that only accepts answers to packets from network sessions that have already been started (from the outside network).
"Reflexive Access-list are activated when a session begins inside the network and leaves the network through the router (operating reflexive Access-list). As a result, it makes a temporary entry for traffic that originates inside the network and only permits outside traffic that is necessary for the session (traffic generated within the network). When the session is over, this transient entry is deleted."
"The source and destination addresses in the entry are identical to those in the outbound packet (the packet leaving the network), with the exception that they are switched when the packet is arriving from outside the network."
"Even if they are switched when coming from outside the network, the entries should contain the same source and destination port numbers as the original outbound packet."
The entry ought to use the same outgoing packet's protocol.
"After a session starts, a temporary entry is created, and it is automatically deleted when the session is over."
The Access-list does not have an implied deny at the end.
"Similar to a standard access list, if one of the conditions is met, no further entries are considered."
"There are two routers: router1 (IP address: 10.1.1.1/24 on fa0/0 and 11.1.1.1/24 on fa0/1), router2 (IP address: 11.1.1.2/24 on fa0/0 and 12.1.1.1/24 on fa0/1) and two PCs (IP addresses: 10.1.1.2/24"" and 12.1.1.2/24,"" respectively). To enable pinging between PCs, we will first provide routes using EIGRP to all of the routers."
"At this point, we'll permit IP, TCP, and UDP traffic from within the network (10.1.1.0 network) and assess traffic arriving from outside the network (12.1.1.0 and 11.1.1.0 network). Making an access list with the name ""reflexive"" for inside traffic leaving."
"Here, IP, TCP, and UDP communication is permitted, and they are designated as the ip database, tcp database, and udp database, respectively."
Reflexive is not a keyword in this context; it is the name of the Access-list. Apply this Access-list now to router1's int fa0/1's outbound so that traffic leaving the router will be permitted.
"Apply an access list now for internal network traffic, also known as inbound traffic. Only that communication, which is started by the internal (10.1.1.0) network, should be allowed to enter."
"Since we have enabled Eigrp traffic here, the routers should be able to communicate with one another; otherwise, no traffic will be able to return to the ether network."
"In order to allow traffic that has been started inside the network using TCP, UDP, or IP, we have evaluated the udp databse, ip database, and tcp database. Apply this now in the inside direction of interface fa0/1 so that the traffic coming in can be assessed."
"Some applications use dynamic ports, which increases the risk of failure since the source and destination ports need to be static for the reflexive Access-list."
"Synchronous Optical Network, or SONET. A communication protocol called SONET was created by Bellcore and is used to send a lot of data over relatively long distances using optical fibre. Multiple digital data streams are transmitted simultaneously over the optical fibre with SONET."
"SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy), which is utilised in Europe and Japan, is comparable."
"Across the entire network, the timing of signal and equipment transmission is controlled by a single clock (the Primary Reference Clock, or PRC)."
It is a repeater that regenerates (increases the strength of) optical signals.
It enables the addition of signals from various sources to a particular path or the removal of a signal.
An electrical signal is changed into an optical signal by SONET so that it can travel farther.
Section: The portion of the network that connects two nearby devices.
Line: A section of the network that links two nearby multiplexers.
It is in charge of transferring signals from their optical source to their optical destination.
It is in charge of signal transmission across a real line.
Add/Drop Mux and STS Mux/Demux both offer Line layer functions.
It is in charge of signal transmission across a physical region.
It includes the optical fibre channel's physical specifications (light is present when 1 and not present when 0).
The SONET/SDH network management system is inadequate for managing and using the DWDM technique.
"Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II are the two security protocols and certification schemes (WPA2). To protect wireless computer networks, the Wi-Fi Alliance has created these. Because of the significant flaws in the prior system, Wired Equivalent Privacy, the Alliance developed these protocols (WEP)."
"In 2003, WPA, also known as the IEEE 802.11i draught standard, became available. The Wi-Fi Alliance created it as a stopgap measure before the more complex and secure WPA2, which became available in 2004 and is a common abbreviation for the complete IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard."
"With several security upgrades over WPA2, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced the release of WPA3 in January 2018."
"Designed to replace WEP, the WPA is a transitional measure. Wireless network interface cards that were made for WEP in 1999 could be updated with WPA firmware. However, the majority of pre-2003 APs could not be upgraded to support WPA because more changes were needed in the wireless access points (APs) than on the network cards."
"The IEEE 802.11i standard is almost entirely implemented by the WPA protocol. WPA adopted the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). On wireless access points and devices, WEP uses a 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key that must be manually entered and that, once entered, cannot be changed. Because TKIP uses a per-packet key, it dynamically generates a new 128-bit key for every packet and thwarts the kinds of attacks that made WEP vulnerable."
"A Message Integrity Check built into WPA is intended to stop an attacker from changing or resending data packets. This took the place of the WEP standard's cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The main problem with CRCs was that they didn't offer strong enough data integrity guarantees for the packets they handled. There were well-proven message authentication codes to address these issues, but they were too computationally intensive for use with older network cards. The integrity of the packets is checked by WPA using the TKIP message integrity check algorithm. Although TKIP is significantly more secure than a CRC, WPA2 uses a more secure algorithm."
"The message integrity code hash function, Michael, which is used to extract the keystream from short packets for use in re-injection and spoofing, was found to have limitations that are similar to earlier WEP flaws."
"WPA was replaced by WPA2. IEEE 802.11i's mandatory components were implemented by WPA2, which is subject to Wi-Fi Alliance testing and certification. In particular, it included essential support for the AES-based CCMP (Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol) encryption mode. In September 2004, certification started. As of March 13, 2006, WPA2 certification is required for all new devices to display the Wi-Fi trademark."
"WPS is a wireless network security standard that aims to make connections between routers and wireless devices faster and easier. WPS is only compatible with wireless networks that use a password protected by the Wifi Protected Access Personal (WPA) or Wifi Protected Access2 (WPA2) Personal security protocols. WPS does not work on wireless networks that use the detested Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security, which can be easily cracked by any hacker with basic skills."
"In a typical configuration, you need to know the network name (also known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID)) and password in order to connect a wireless device to a wireless network (also called WPA-PSK key). You must first select the network you want to connect to and then enter its security password on your device if you want to connect a device, such as your smartphone or laptop, to your wireless network."
Sometimes the connection process can be made simpler by WPS. The following describes how to make a WPS connection:
"To enable the discovery of new devices, first press the WPS button on your router. Next, on your device, choose the network you want to connect to. Without entering the network password, the device joins the wireless network automatically."
"Devices with their own WPS button can be connected quickly, such as wireless printers and range extenders. By pressing the WPS button on the router and then on those devices, these devices can be connected to a wireless network. No information needs to be entered at any point in the procedure."
"An eight-digit PIN is used in a third technique. The PIN code on every router with WPS turned on is generated automatically and cannot be changed by the user. On your router's WPS configuration page, you can find this PIN. Even though some devices lack a WPS button, they still require the PIN because they support WPS. They authenticate themselves and connect to the wireless network if the pin is entered."
The final technique also uses an eight-digit PIN. Some devices that support WPS but lack a WPS button create a client PIN. The router will use this PIN when you enter it in the wireless configuration panels of your router to add that device to the network.
"The first two methods are quick, whereas the last two methods offer no advantages in terms of how quickly devices connect to your wireless network. It is necessary to type the eight-digit PIN, and typing the wireless network password takes too long. The fourth method of connecting to a wireless network is even slower because the client device's PIN must be entered and the wireless configuration section of the router must be accessed."
"When WPS is enabled on a network, an access point automatically configures its network name (SSID) and WPA security key."
"When syncing WPS-capable devices, the SSID security key or passphrase is not required to be known."
"Since WPS keys are generated at random, no one can predict or deduce your security key or passphrase."
It is not necessary to enter lengthy hexadecimal code or passphrase sequences.
"One of the authentication protocols used in WPA2 is the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which is used to securely exchange data and network credentials over the air."
"WPS does not support network mode, which allows wireless devices to communicate with one another directly without an access point."
"If there are WiFi devices on the network that are WPS certified or WPS-compatible, the WPS cannot be used."
"Given that the WPS technology generates lengthy sequences of hexadecimal characters, adding a non-WPS client device to the network is very challenging."
"The WPS protocol relies on an exchange of descriptive information that should take place before the user's action to initiate a series of EAP message exchanges. A new Information Element (IE) is added to the beacon, probe response, and, optionally, the probe request and association request/response messages to carry the descriptive information. In addition to type-length values that are purely informative, those IEs will also contain information about the device's potential and current configuration options."
"After this exchange of information about each end's device capabilities, the user starts the actual protocol session. The session consists of eight messages, and if the session is successful, a message signalling the end of the protocol follows. When using different physical media or configuring different types of devices (AP or STA), the precise stream of messages may vary (wired or wireless)."
"ACLs are a set of rules for regulating network traffic and minimising network threats. Using a set of rules specified for the network's incoming or outgoing traffic, ACLs are used to filter traffic. Here, we can see that the source parameter is being searched for by the standard Acess list. Therefore, they won't be concerned with the layer 2 frame header; instead, they will examine the packet header, namely the source field, and match solely based on that. Therefore, they won't delve further into the transit layer."
"These are Access-lists that are created solely utilising the source IP address. These ACLs either allow or disallow the whole set of protocols. TCP, UDP, HTTPS, and other types of IP transmission are not differentiated. The router will recognise it as a regular ACL and the provided address as the source IP address if you use the numbers 1-99 or 1300-1999."
"In general, standard access lists are used near to the destination ( but not always )."
A standard access list prohibits access to the entire network or sub network.
"The range of the standard access-list is 1 to 99, and the expanded range is 1300 to 1999."
Only the source IP address is used to implement the standard access-list.
Remember rules cannot be deleted if numbered with a normal Access-list is used. The entire access list will be destroyed if one of the rules is removed.
You have the option to remove a rule from the access list if named with standard Access list is used.
"The sales, finance, and marketing departments are the three in this modest topology. The networks for the marketing department are 172.16.60.0/24, the finance department is 172.16.50.0/24, and the sales department is 172.16.40.0/24. In order to prevent others from accessing that network, you now wish to block connections from the sales department to the finance department."
"To prevent any IP connection from the sales department to the finance department, first configure a numbered standard access list."
"Similar to extended access-list, you cannot specify the specific IP traffic that should be allowed or blocked here. Please also note the use of the wildcard mask ( 0. 0. 0. 255 which means Subnet mask 255. 255. 255. 0). The number 10 is taken from the access-list standard range."
"As you are already aware, every access list has an implicit refuse at the end, which indicates that if the traffic does not comply with any of the access list's rules, the traffic will be discarded."
Only traffic that complies with the aforementioned rules that you have specified will reach the finance department by specifying any means from a source with any IP address.
You must now apply the access list to the router's interface:
"Remembering that the standard access-list is typically applied to the destination, outbound to interface fa0/1 has been applied since it will meet our needs if it is applied close to the destination."
You will now create a named standard access list while still keeping in mind the same structure.
You have created an access-list called blockacl by running this command.
The identical setup that you did in the numbered access-list is then applied.
"Telnet connection can be allowed or denied using standard access-list by applying access-list on line vty lines. As you are aware, you cannot specify specific IP traffic to be prohibited in standard access-list."
"Here, in the provided figure, you want to prevent telnet access from any network to the Finance department. Setting up for the same:"
"The principal application of an access-list is packet filtering. If one of the conditions matches, it is executed and no other condition is matched further. It is a sequential set of different permit or deny criteria. Additionally, it ends with an implicit denial, therefore the rules ought to have at least one permit condition."
"But in this section, we'll talk about time-based access lists."
Time-based access-lists are a particular kind of access-list that regulate network access according to time intervals. It is helpful when you wish to impose limitations on outbound or incoming traffic based on a specific time of day or specific days of the week.
"For instance, let's say we wish to restrict Internet access during business hours but allowing it over lunch. We can use time-based access-lists to block access to the Internet in situations like these."
"In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.0.1.T, time-based ACLs were introduced to enable access control based on the time. Although router clocks can be used, NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronisation is recommended."
"Define time-range - First, we must define a time-range, which can be specified using the keywords absolute or periodic.

absolute: specifies a specific time. For instance, if we want to restrict ICMP traffic to a subnet from Tuesday to Friday (absolute time), we will use the absolute keyword.
periodic: specifies a time interval. For instance, if we want to block ICMP on a specific subnet every weekday (Monday through Friday), we can use the periodic keyword."
"absolute: specifies a specific time. For instance, if we want to restrict ICMP traffic to a subnet from Tuesday to Friday (absolute time), we will use the absolute keyword."
"periodic: specifies a time interval. For instance, if we want to block ICMP on a specific subnet every weekday (Monday through Friday), we can use the periodic keyword."
"Define an access-list - In the next step, we will define an access-list to which we will apply our time-range."
Apply an access-list to an interface - The access-list will now be applied to an interface or line-vty based on our requirements.
"There is a simple topology consisting of PC1 (ip address 10.1.1.2/24), router (ip address 10.1.1.1/24 on fa0/0 and 10.1.2.1/24 on fa0/1), PC2 (ip address 10.1.2.2/24) and two switches, Sw1 and Sw2, with all ports in vlan 1. We can see that after configuring these, PC1 can ping PC2."
"In this scenario, we will deny PC1 the ability to ping PC2 within the time-range specified, and then apply this time-range to an access-list. Finally, we will apply this to a router interface. Also, we know that it works best with NTP, but in this case, we will use the router's local clock."
We can view a router's clock by issuing the following command:
We can also change the clock time with the following command:
"Now, we'll define time-range by first specifying the time we want PC1 to be blocked in order for PC2 to ping PC1."
"The name of time flow is time-range (any name can be given). We've given you the time range of 00:15 to 00:20 on July 1.
The use of an absolute keyword is demonstrated here."
"If a scenario necessitates a periodic time span, it can be represented as:"
Periodic is the name of the time-range in this case. The second command indicates that ping from 10.1.1.2 to 10.1.2.2 will be prohibited on all weekdays (Monday through Friday) from 0:15 to 0:20. (after we apply this time-range to an access-list and then applying access-list to an interface as described further).
Defining an extended access-list called Time acl that will allow ICMP traffic to pass through the router during the time-range we specify.
"Now, we'll apply this access-list to the router's outbound interface fa0/1 to deny traffic in the time-range (time flow) that we've defined."
We will be unable to ping 10.1.2.2 within the timeframe we have set.
It gives an administrator more control over traffic because it can be denied or permitted based on time.
"Technology is improving day by day, and we come up with various new technologies on a daily basis. Internet is also changing rapidly; initially, it started as just a document repository, which has now become a full-fledged resource that provides various services to us."
"In our daily life, most of us are highly dependent on the internet to connect with our family & friends, get the work done, and much more. But as it is also changing, what will it look like after 50-100 years? It might give us a completely different way to approach things globally."
"The internet we are using is in the form of 2D internet, but it is ready to change to 3D internet. 3D is an entirely new concept in internet technology and is also known as a virtual world. 3D Internet is about to provide 3D experiences that can replicate real life. In this topic, we will discuss in detail 3D Internet as well as how it works, the Applications of 3D Internet, and the Advantages and Disadvantages of 3D Internet. So, let's start with the introduction of the 3D Internet."
"3D Internet is the successor of 2D internet (existing internet), but it provides a 3D experience or a virtual world that can replicate real life. It provides a powerful new way to reach consumers or business customers by consuming various web services."
"The 3D internet is mainly a combination of two factors, which are the Internet and 3D Graphics. It can provide one of the most interactive and engaging services compared to Television. One of the best examples of 3D internet is Second Life, a 3D online virtual world in which different avatars do different kinds of stuff similar to real life."
"People often think that when 2D Internet is already there, which is working perfectly, then what is the need for 3D Internet? Most people worldwide are highly dependent on the internet for doing their daily work, from online shopping and communication to bill payments and many more. If we talk about the nature of the current Internet, it is of a 2D type, which means that it is just a virtual environment where people from all over the world share ideas, interact with each other and exchange information. But why restrict it just to 2D pages and hyperlinks when there are lots of things that are turning in 3D, and it can be more attractive and engaging."
"In 2D internet, each website is a typical combination of a bunch of documents, 2D pages, images or videos. To navigate the websites or for web surfing, we need a search engine like Google. But we can do it in an alternate and much better way than in real life, which is our 3D world. Similarly, we can make our internet the 3D virtual world, which can replicate the real world and give us much better services and experiences than imagination. Imagine we can put our documents on the desk at home, where documents, desks, and home are ""virtual"" entities that are 3D representations of real-world counterparts with spatial relationships."
"3D internet can be used as an excellent platform for Education by Schools, Colleges, and Universities. With 3D internet, students will be able to understand the concepts of some typical subjects easily that need a 3D view of things such as Chemistry, Physics, etc., rather than the traditional ways."
"With the use of 3D internet, different religious organizations can organize virtual meet for different people at a specific location."
"It is always necessary to have complete information about the location where you want to visit on holidays. So, with 3D internet, tourists can get a complete 3D view of interesting locations and can decide accordingly. It will save the time invested in searching about locations, and people will have a better idea about different locations."
"3D internet can also be widely used for entertainment purposes, including 3D Games and Movies. With the 3D internet, people can play different sports, such as Cricket, football, boxing, etc., in the 3D environment."
"Virtual embassies could be created in 3D internet, which will help the visitors to talk face-to-face with a compute generator ambassador to know about visas, trade, and other Issues."
"3D internet could be employed in Arts. With it, artists will be able to create new forms of art and designs that are not possible in real life due to some physical limitations and high costs. It also enables artists to display their designs to audiences across the world with a real-life look and feel."
"Nowadays, people are much more active on Online social media platforms. With the help of the 3D internet, social media networking can be much more interactive and engaging, such as experiencing video calls."
"3D internet can transform and could be much beneficial for the Real Estate market. With it, customers can have a complete 3D view of the property online in which they are interested."
"World server provides static and dynamic content created by either user or server-side and generates a specific 3D environment or web place that includes visuals, avatar data, media, etc., to client programs. Its main task is to coordinate with the connecting users, initiate communication between them, and ensure in-world consistency in real-time. It also provides different services to users, including email, instant sagging, etc."
"In 3D internet, there is a virtual identity management system that contains identity and avatar information along with an inventory of registered users. The system provides all this information to specific world servers and relevant client programs(owner) with complete privacy and security of contained information. It can also be a part of world servers."
"Virtual location management systems are similar to current DNS, which provide virtual geographical information. Moreover, it also provides a connection to the internet using methods similar to SLurl. They can also work as a distributed directory of the world, avatar servers and users."
"Clients are browser-like viewer programs that run on the end-users device containing extensive networking, caching, and 3D rendering capabilities."
"If we talk about the internet, then speed is one the main thing that comes out immediately to easily navigate web pages. If internet speed is not sufficient, then users may face various trouble during web surfing. To use 3D internet, speed is the most significant implication. Still, various countries across the world are not in the state of implementation of 3D internet."
Solution: Speed issues of 3D internet would be resolved by implementing high-speed cellular networks such as 3G and 4G (5G in the near future). These cellular networks have higher transmission rates to access the internet at high speed.
"The main hardware implication for 3D internet is the screen display of the device to display the data. Currently, we are using the 2D display in all devices that can display images and other documents in 2D format only. But with the 3D internet, it would be difficult to display 3D objects on 2D screens. Current computer displays have a max 50-degree field of view which require the user to move the mouse in order to see the complete image, which is completely different from the real world. In the real world, we can use peripheral vision to see things beyond the direct line of sight."
"The hardware implication problem of 3D internet can be resolved by using 3D Goggles (for now). In the market, a variety of 3D goggles are available, which can be used to see objects in 3D 2D devices."
"Apart from using 3D goggles, with the use of Vision Station, we can solve the hardware implication issue. A vision station is a computer display technology which provides 180 degrees of viewing angles for users."
"With the 3D internet, discussing and sharing ideas is easy and efficient."
"3D films will not be pirated, which will help the movie industry with good gain."
3D internet will give a better experience while interacting and communicating.
Mobile communication is a way to communicate with other people at a different locations without any physical connection. It enables to transmission of voice and multimedia data from one mobile or computer device to another without any need for a physical connection between them. A Mobile phone or Cellular phone is an example of mobile communication.
"Since the introduction of mobile communication, this technology has come a long way and has evolved a lot. Many technological developments have been made to make mobile communication more efficient and serve users better. It was introduced as 1G (First Generation- Voice-only communication), and today we are widely using 4G technology. 4G is the fourth Generation of mobile network technology, which is the successor of 3G and preceded by the 5G network. It provides a much higher data transmission speed than its successor networks, making it preferable at this stage of a fast lifestyle. In this topic, we will learn more about 4G Mobile communication, its introduction, working, availability, etc."
"4G is known as the fourth Generation of Mobile Communication or wireless communication technology, which is the successor of the 3G network. It provides high data transmission speed and is suitable for HD video calling, fast download and upload, live streaming, online gaming, etc. A 4G system must adhere to the capabilities and features specified by the ITU(International Telecommunication Union) in IMT advanced, including transmission technology and data speed. 4G network provides up to 100 Mbps speed to users, far higher than a 3G network."
4G enables users to stream high-definition audio and videos without interruption due to its high speed. It also facilitates wireless broadband that allows the users to access the internet without any need for fixed wired.
It aims to provide high data transmission speed without interruption at any location.
"As per ITU standard, a 4G network system must have the highest data rates of 100Mbs for highly mobile stations like trains, cars etc."
"It is very well suitable for the transmission of voice, data, signals, multimedia, wireless internet, and other broadband services."
It provides a better way for scheduling and calling admission control techniques.
"LTE (Long-Term Evolution)
LTE stands for Long-Term evolution, a standard for high-speed wireless communication commonly used in 4G connections. It is technically different from 4G, i.e., 4G and 4G LTE are not technically the same. LTE data is transmitted with faster speed and lower latency. The connectivity for the LTE network is available universally around the world for both customers and industrial applications.
The term LTE is specifically used for marketing purposes, as specified speed and technical specifications defined for 4G were not achievable when it was introduced. Hence LTE provides much more speed and bandwidth than 3G but does not imply a specific rate. Depending on the carrier, speed ranges from 20 Mbps to 100 Mbps"
"Worldwide Interoperability for Microwaves Access (WiMAX)
WiMAX is a type or representative of 4G wireless internet. It is similar to wifi, which enables the user to access the internet without the need for wires. However, it is a bit different from wifi, as unlike wifi (which covers a building or city), it can cover vast distances such as cell phone networks with high-speed internet access similar to broadband. A Mobile WiMax is a type of 4G network, but all 4G networks are not WiMAX. The peak data rates offered by WiMAX are 128 Mbps for downlink and 56 Mbps for uplink over 20 MHz wide channels."
"At a basic level, a 4G mobile connection transmits the signal via an antenna over radio frequencies, which allows mobile devices to connect to mobile networks."
"The 4G capabilities for transmitting and receiving the signal are based on Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technologies. Due to these technologies, 4G offers high capacity and bandwidth comparison to 3G."
"MIMO technology reduces network congestion as compared to 3G, and hence services can be served to more users without network congestion."
4G network supports all-IP standards for both voice and data transmission. 4G is more efficient for mobile network providers to operate and optimize than managing different network technologies for voice and data because of the all-IP network.
"With a 4G connection, users don't need any phone line or wired connection. Instead, it works using the same internet connection as the mobile phone."
"4G provides portability, which means with this connection, users can take the internet anywhere at any time."
"With 4G, the cost of internet services has fallen down highly compared to 3G. Hence, it gives high-speed internet at less cost."
"Nowadays, everything is being hosted online, and hence users require high internet to work with cloud services, and it is possible with 4G (and upcoming 5G) connections."
"It depends on the network signal; if the signal gets weaker, then the user experiences slow and unstable services."
"Although 4G is much more efficient and fast compared to 3G, it is still lacking compatibility with the fast-growing technologies that need many high-speed networks. Hence after 4G, 5G Technology is ready to make a boom in the mobile communication sector. 5G mobile phones with extremely high data rates, IP core, and worldwide coverage will offer features which have not been imagined so far."
"Currently, 5G is neither available worldwide nor being used universally as it requires a lot of changes in network infrastructure and other things. It will drastically change the current landscape of mobile communication. It is currently available in the US, China, Canada, Italy etc. However, very soon, it will be available worldwide."
"When we talk about a Headset or Earphones, there are wired regular earphones that we physically connect to our phones, and there are wireless Bluetooth headsets that we connect via Bluetooth. Transmission via Bluetooth is one of the simplest and most prominent examples of wireless transmission media."
"Wireless data transmission is also called ""Unguided Transmission"" or ""Unbounded Transmission"" because of the absence of physical boundaries. When we turn on the Bluetooth on our phone and connect a headset, our phone and the device communicate with each other using ultra high-frequency Radio waves-one of the wireless transmission media."
This tutorial explains about three major wireless transmission media in details with examples around us.
"IR or Infrared radiation is a part of electromagnetic radiation. These rays have a wavelength greater than visible light, making them invisible to the human eye. We cannot see Infrared light but feel the rays in the form of heat. Frequency range: 300 GHz to 400 THz."
"When we look at a fire, we can feel the heat from it and see it because it emits visible light and Infrared energy. The human body also emits heat but only in the form of Infrared light. Instruments such as night-vision goggles and Infrared cameras can capture Infrared light."
"Sun is the biggest source of Infrared radiation. Hence, it causes a lot of interference in Infrared communication. One most important point about Infrared rays is that these rays cannot penetrate through walls. Hence, the applications of Infrared rays lie within a contained space."
"So, how does the data transfer take place using this Infrared light?"
"Let us apply for Infrared data transfer and see how it is happening. The most used application is the ""TV Remote control"". When we press a button on the remote, how is it changing the channel on the TV?"
"An Infrared Light emitting diode is embedded into the TV remote and an IR detector is inserted into the TV. This detector converts the Infrared light signal from the remote and converts it into an electrical signal. Hence, the remote acts as a transmitter and the TV as a receiver."
All the buttons on a TV remote are connected to a microprocessor which generates a unique binary code for each button pressed. All these codes will be of the same length. The LED flashes on and off according to the generated pattern of the pressed button.
"The detector on the TV will be pre-programmed to interpret the binary codes and perform the requested actions. These binary codes vary from company to company and device to device, which is why we can't control a TV with a remote that doesn't belong to it. Although, a universal remote has all the codes programmed into it, which is why it can control any TV."
"If there is some object between your remote and the TV, the detector on the TV might not be able to get the Infrared rays from the remote as these rays can't penetrate through objects. New technology led to various changes in Remote control, like using Radio waves instead of Infrared, mobile apps, voice control, etc."
"Due to its Line of sight propagation, the transmitter needs to be aligned with the receiver to transmit the data."
"It can't propagate through obstructions like walls, wood, and other opaque objects."
Some receivers might respond to other transmitters breaking the security policy.
High interference rate due to sunlight and other large Infrared sources.
"Like Infrared radiation, Radio waves are also a part of electromagnetic radiation. These waves have the longest wavelengths, from 1mm to 100km in the spectrum. The name itself has Radio. A Radio is one of the thousands of wireless technologies that use Radio waves for communication."
"A Radio is the simplest example of Radio wave communication. Other examples include RADAR, Satellite communications, Bluetooth headsets, TV Broadcasts, GPS Signals, etc. Frequency range: 300GHz to 3kHz."
"Like in Infrared communication, there will be a Radio wave transmitter and a receiver. All the Radios today use continuous sine waves to transmit information, as almost every single person on the planet uses these waves in one form or another. The information can be from audio, video, sound, and textual data. Suppose a person is using Radio, sine waves are transmitted from it, and if another person uses a TV, it also broadcasts sine waves. How are these signals separated and identified? Every single Radio signal will have a different frequency for the sine waves."
A Radio station is an equipment installation with one or more transmitters or receivers.
The information in any form is encoded into sine waves and is transmitted into the air by radiating the waves through an Antenna.
The Antenna on the receiver's side captures the Radio waves and decodes the information from the sine waves.
"To transmit Radio signals, there is a need for a transmitting antenna on the transmitter's side and a receiving antenna at the receiver's side."
"The frequency of a wave is inversely proportional to wavelength, and the length of the Antenna is directly proportional to the wavelength of the wave."
"Let us take an example of a sound wave. The frequency range a human ear can sense is 20Hz to 20kHz. If we try to transmit the Radio wave at the same frequency as the sound waves, the length of the antennas required will be in kilometers. It is not feasible."
"We need the antenna height to be low, which means we need the Radio wave with high frequency. Hence, a signal with high frequency is taken, and its characteristics (amplitude or frequency, phase or pulse) are altered to store the information."
"After the modulation process, we'll get a high-frequency wave with all the data encoded into the wave. This wave is transmitted to the receiver Radio station, and demodulation is done to extract the blended data."
"Observe that there are FM Radios, AM Radios, and PM Radios based on the type of Modulation the Radio wave is going through to carry the information."
"The first wave is the message the Transmitter wants to send. The next wave is a new signal with high frequency with no data in it. Now, the carrier signal is modified in terms of its frequency to carry the data in the message signal like a Morse code. This data will be demodulated to get back the message at the receiver's side."
These waves are Omnidirectional which means they can be transmitted in all directions.
These waves are also a part of electromagnetic radiation. The micro indicates that these waves have short wavelengths from 1 meter to 1 millimeter. These are high-frequency waves-> Frequency range: 300MHz to 300GHz. These waves fall between Radio waves and Infrared waves.
"These waves are used for point-to-point communication as it only transmits data in one direction. These can transmit all kinds of data, from audio to video. These waves can be used to transmit thermal energy too."
Communication using Microwaves can be done only if the transmitting and receiving antennas are properly aligned- Line of sight transmission.
"A group of digital devices that are interconnected using wired or wireless connections for the purpose of exchanging data with each other is known as computer networking. The first computer network was ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). Computer network sharing provides resources, backing up data, scalability, good communication speed, reliability, software and hardware sharing, security, etc."
"Hubs, bridges, switches, modems, gateways, routers, repeaters, etc., are needed to form a computer network. Networks can be small or large."

"A network is a collection of different devices connected and capable of communicating. For example, a company's local network connects employees' computers and devices like printers and scanners. Employees will be able to share information using the network and also use the common printer/ scanner via the network. Data to be transferred or communicated from one device to another comes in various formats like audio, video, etc. This tutorial explains how different data types are represented in a computer and transferred in a network."
"Data in text format is represented using bit patterns (combinations of two binary bits - 0 and 1). Textual data is nothing but a string, and a string is a collection of characters. Each character is given a specific number according to an international standard called Unicode. The process of allocating numbers to characters is called ""Coding,"" and these numbers are called ""codes"". Now, these codes are converted into binary bits to represent the textual data in a pattern of bits, and these bits are transferred as a stream via the network to other devices."
"It is the universal standard of character encoding. It gives a unique code to almost all the characters in every language spoken in the world. It defines more than 1 40 000 characters. It even defined codes for emojis. The first 128 characters of Unicode point to ASCII characters. ASCII is yet another character encoding format, but it has only 128 codes to 128 characters. Hence, ASCII is a subset of Unicode."
Numbers are directly converted into binary patterns by dividing by 2 without any encoding. The numbers we want to transfer generally will be of the decimal number system- ( )10. We need to convert the numbers from ( )10  to a binary number system - ( )2 to get a bit stream.
"Image data is also transferred as a stream of bits like textual data. An image, also called a picture, is a collection of little elements called ""Pixels"". A single pixel is the smallest addressable element of a picture, and it is like a dot with a size of 1/96 inch/ 0.26 mm. The dimensions of an image are given by the number of pixels along the height of the image X Number of pixels along the width of the image."
"A black-and-white/ Grayscale image consists of white, black, and all the shades in between. It can be considered as just the varying intensity of the White color. The intensity of the white color in a pixel is given by numbers called ""Pixel values"". The pixel value in a Grayscale image can be in the range of 0 to 255, where 0 represents Black and 255 represents White, and all the numbers in the interval represent different shades. A matrix is created for the image with pixel values of all the pixels in the image. This matrix is called a ""Channel""."
"Each pixel comprises three transistors representing three standard colors: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB), Yellow, Cyan, and Magenta (YCM). Any color known can be generated by using these three colors. Based on the intensity of a color in the pixel, three matrices/ channels for each color are generated."
"Suppose there is a colored image, and three matrices are created for Red, Green, and Blue colors in each pixel in the image:"
"The first pixel's intensities of Red, Green and Blue colors are [141, 35, 31]. In this way, every pixel is analyzed and converted into binary bits"
", and this bit stream is transferred to any other device in the network to communicate the image. N-bit streams are used to represent 2N possible colors. From 0 to 255, we can represent 256 shades of color with different 8-bit patterns."
"For example, an image consists of only either black or white colors, only one bit will be enough to represent the pixels:"
"Transferring an audio signal is different from other formats. Audio is broadcasting recorded sound or music. An audio signal is generated as an analog wave, converted into digital format to be stored in a computer by representing the wave amplitude at moments in bits. Another parameter is the sample rate. It represents the number of samples or, in other words, samples saved."
"The audio quality depends on the sampling rate and the bit rate. If more bits are used to represent the amplitudes in moments and more moments are captured accurately, we can save the audio with every detail accurately."
"A video is a collection of frames; each frame is a picture with the same or different dimensions. These frames/ images are represented as matrices, as we discussed above. All the frames/ images are displayed continuously, one after the other, to show a video in movement. To represent a video, The computer will analyze data about the video like:"
Bit depth (Number of bits required to represent a pixel -> number of colors)
"A video is mostly combined with an audio component, like a film or a video game."
"A Network is a group of connected devices capable of communicating. The device can be a computer, printer, or scanner that either receives or transmits data. The devices connected in the Network are called ""Nodes,"" and the means of connection can be wired or wireless."
This tutorial explains the criteria a computer network must attain to fulfill all the connected nodes' needs properly.
"There are a lot of criteria that make a network better than others, but; there are three basic yet important criteria to be fulfilled for a network:"
"It measures how well a network can support communication between two nodes in the Network or with nodes of other networks in the global scope. The two major tasks in a network are the Transmission and reception of information. We need to focus on how fast a message is transmitted and how fast a node can receive a request and find the needed information. Hence, to measure the performance of a network, here are the major factors to be considered:"
Transit time: The total time a node takes to transmit a message from the beginning until the last character of the message. Transit stands for Transmission.
Response time: The total time a node takes to process an inquiry or a request from another node/ device and respond. It is the time between the inquiry's end and the response's beginning.
Throughput: Throughput measures how much data is transferred successfully from the sender node to the receiver node in a particular time frame. It is measured in bits per second or data per second.
"Bandwidth: The maximum possible throughput capacity of the Network. We can measure it in bits, megabits, or gigabits per second. It defines the highest limit."
"Delay/ Latency: As we discussed, Throughput is the number of data packets successfully delivered in a given time. Delay is the measure of time taken to do the delivery."
"A network with high Throughput and less latency is ideal, but Throughput and latency always lie on two sides of the coin and are always proportional. If we try to automatically increase the data packet transfer, the time taken is also increased."
"Throughput and bandwidth might seem similar, but they are different. Bandwidth is conceptual, while Throughput is practical. Bandwidth is like the vehicle limit of a highway. The number of vehicles/ data packets we are allowing is the Throughput."
"Both Bandwidth and Throughput are important for the Network's speed. For fast data transfer, we can transfer more data packets, but too much data/ vehicles reduce the speed and might cause congestion; there is only one way than making the bandwidth wider. Hence, bandwidth is important though conceptual."
"Several other factors influence a network's performance:

Number of users
Hardware capability
Transmission media used.
Software efficiency
Jitter (disturbance)"
Latency and Throughput are the two networking metrics that are periodically measured to keep up with the performance of the Network.
"It is the degree to which a network is trustworthy, consistent, and dependable. The Reliability of a network is measured by the frequency of failures it is undergoing and the time it takes to recover from the failures. Overall, the Robustness of the Network at times of catastrophic events is measured to check how reliable the Network is."
"It measures how the Network secures the data amid failures and attacks and the policies and procedures it implements to protect itself from damages and unauthorized access. In Reliability, the frequency of failures is checked. In Security, network attacks and data breaches are checked."
"Performance: The performance of a network is measured by measuring the Throughput and Delay of the Network. The ideal type of Network is supposed to have high Throughput and low delay, which are two proportional metrics. Other important factors determining a network's performance are Transit time and Response time."
Reliability: The Reliability of a network lies in how robust the Network is amid sudden major catastrophic events/ failures.
"Security: It is how the Network protects all the important data and information at times of data breaches, unauthorized logins, damages, and viruses."
"IPV4 Addresses, Classful Addressing, Classless Addressing, and the difference between Classful and Classless addressing are discussed in this article."
"The IP address, often known as the Internet address, is the unique identifier used in the IP layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite to identify each device's connection to the Internet. A host's or router's connection to the Internet is defined by its 32-bit IPv4 address, which is unique and used worldwide. The IP address, not the host or router, is what identifies the connection because it could change if the device is relocated to a different network."
"Since each address specifies a single and exclusive connection to the Internet, IPv4 addresses are distinctive. A device has two IPv4 addresses if it has two networks connecting to the Internet through it. Because every host that wishes to connect to the Internet must use the IPv4 addressing scheme, IPv4 addresses are considered universal."
"The addressing system is hierarchical in every type of communication network that requires delivery, including phone and postal networks."
"Although it is separated into two parts, a 32-bit IPv4 address is also hierarchical. The network is defined by the first component of the address, known as the prefix, and the node is defined by the second component, known as the suffix (connection of a device to the Internet). A 32-bit IPv4 address's prefix and suffix are shown in the given figure. The lengths of the prefix and suffix are n bits and (32 - n) bits, respectively."
"Prefixes can have variable or fixed lengths. The IPv4 network identification was initially intended to be a fixed-length prefix. Classful addressing is the term used to describe this outmoded system. The brand-new addressing method, known as classless addressing, makes use of a variable-length network prefix. Prior to focusing on classless addressing, we briefly explore classful addressing."
"An IPv4 address originally had a fixed-length prefix, but three fixed-length prefixes (n = 8, n = 16, and n = 24) were created in order to support both small and big networks. As shown in the figure below, the entire address space was partitioned into five classes (classes A, B, C, D, and E). Classful addressing is the term used to describe this system. Despite being a thing of the past, classful addressing aids in the comprehension of classless addressing, which is covered in the later section."
"CLASS A - Despite the fact that the network length is 8 bits, we can only use seven bits for the network identifier since the first bit, which is 0 and determines the class, is part of the length. This indicates that only 27 = 128 networks can have a class A address globally."
Net ID = 8bits long and Host ID = 24 bits long
"Method to identify class A addresses:

The first bit is reserved to 0 in binary
Range of the first octet is [0, 127] in dotted decimal"
"Range of the first octet is [0, 127] in dotted decimal"
"Total number of connections in Class A = 231 (2, 14, 74, 83, 648)"
"There are 27 - 2 = 126 networks in the Class A network.

There are 2 fewer networks available overall since IP Address 0.0.0.0 is set aside for broadcasting needs. For usage as a loopback address while testing software, the IP address 127.0.0.1 is set aside.
Hence, the range of the first octet becomes [1, 126]"
"There are 2 fewer networks available overall since IP Address 0.0.0.0 is set aside for broadcasting needs. For usage as a loopback address while testing software, the IP address 127.0.0.1 is set aside."
"Hence, the range of the first octet becomes [1, 126]"
"Total number of Host IDs in Class A = 224 - 2 [1, 67, 77, 214]

There are 2 fewer hosts that can be established across all classes due to the two reserved IP addresses, where all of the host ID bits are either zero or one.
The Network ID for the network is represented when all of the Host ID bits are set to 0.
The Broadcast Address is represented when all of the Host ID bits are set to 1."
"There are 2 fewer hosts that can be established across all classes due to the two reserved IP addresses, where all of the host ID bits are either zero or one."
The Network ID for the network is represented when all of the Host ID bits are set to 0.
The Broadcast Address is represented when all of the Host ID bits are set to 1.
"Organizations needing very large networks, like Indian Railways, employ class A."
"CLASS B - Despite the fact that the first two bits of class B's network, which are 10 in binary or we can write it as (10)2, determine the class, we can only use 14 bits as the network identification, as class B's network length is 16 bits. As a result, only 214 = 16,384 networks in the entire world are capable of using a class B address."
Length of Net Id = 16 bits and length of Host ID 16 bits.
"Method to identify Class B networks:

First two bits are reserved to 10 in binary notation
The Range of the first octet is [128, 191] in dotted decimal notation"
First two bits are reserved to 10 in binary notation
"The Range of the first octet is [128, 191] in dotted decimal notation"
"Total number of connections in the class B network is 230 = 1, 07, 37, 41, 824"
"Total number of networks available in class B is 214 = 16, 384"
"Total number of hosts that can be configured in Class B = 216 - 2 = 165, 534"
"CLASS C - All addresses that begin with the number (110)2 fall under class C. Class C networks are 24 bits long, but since the class is defined by three bits, the network identifier can only be 21 bits long. As a result, 221 = 2, 097, 152 networks worldwide are capable of using a class C address."
The length of the Net Id and the Host Id = 24 bits and 16 bits respectively.
"Method to identify Class C networks:

First three bits are reserved for 110 in binary notation or (110)2.
The range of the first octet is [192, 223] in dotted decimal notation."
First three bits are reserved for 110 in binary notation or (110)2.
"The range of the first octet is [192, 223] in dotted decimal notation."
"Total number of connections in Class C = 229 = 53, 68, 70, 912."
"Total number of networks available in Class C = 224 = 20, 97, 152."
Total number of hosts that can be configured in every network in Class C = 28 - 2 = 254.
Organizations needing small to medium-sized networks typically choose class C.
Quick Quiz - The maximum number of networks that can use Class C addresses in the IPv4 addressing format is __________
CLASS D - Prefix and suffix categories do not exist for Class D. It is employed for multicast addresses.
There is no concept of Host ID and Net ID
"Method to identify Class D network:

The first four bits are reserved to 1110 in binary notation or (1110)2
The range of the first octet is [224, 239] in dotted decimal notation"
The first four bits are reserved to 1110 in binary notation or (1110)2
"The range of the first octet is [224, 239] in dotted decimal notation"
"Total number of IP addresses available is 228 = 26, 84, 35, 456"
"Because data is not intended for a specific host, Class D is set aside for multicasting, which eliminates the requirement to extract the host address from the IP address."
"CLASS E - All binary addresses with the prefix 1111 fall under class E. Class E, like Class D, does not have a prefix or a suffix and is used as a reserve."
"Like in Class D, there is also no concept of Host ID and Net ID."
"Method to identify Class E networks:

The first four bits are reserved to 1111 in binary notation or (1111)
The range of the first octet is [240, 255] in dotted decimal notation."
The first four bits are reserved to 1111 in binary notation or (1111)
"The range of the first octet is [240, 255] in dotted decimal notation."
"Total number of IP addresses available is 228 = 26,84,35,456."
Class E is set aside for hypothetical or experimental uses.
"The address depletion issue was not fully resolved by classful addressing's subnetting and supernetting techniques. As the Internet expanded, it became obvious that a bigger address space was required as a long-term fix. However, the expanded address space necessitates that IP addresses should be longer as well, necessitating a change in IP packet syntax. The short-term solution, which uses the same address space but modifies the distribution of addresses to deliver a fair amount to each business, was developed despite the fact that the long-term solution, known as IPv6, has already been developed. Classless addressing is the temporary fix, which nevertheless makes use of IPv4 addresses. In order to make up for address depletion, the class privilege was taken out of the distribution."
"The entire address space is partitioned into blocks of varying lengths with classless addressing. An address's prefix designates the block (network); its suffix designates the node (device). We are capable of having a block of 20, 21, 22 ,..., 232 addresses, theoretically. One of the limitations is that a block of addresses must have a power of two addresses. One address block may be given to an organization. The given figure demonstrates the non-overlapping block segmentation of the entire address space."
"In contrast to classful addressing, classless addressing allows for varying prefix lengths. Prefix lengths that vary from 0 to 32 are possible. The length of the prefix has an inverse relationship with network size. A smaller network has a large prefix; a larger one has a small prefix."
"We must stress that classful addressing is just as easily adaptable to the concept of classless addressing. Consider an address in class A as a classless address with a prefix length of 8. Class B addresses can be viewed as classless addresses with the prefix 16 and so on. Putting it another way, classless addressing is a specific instance of classful addressing."
"In classless addressing, the first issue that needs to be resolved is how to determine the prefix length if an address is provided. We must individually provide the prefix length because it is not a property of the address. The address is inserted in this scenario, followed by a slash, and the prefix length, n. Slash notation is the colloquial name for the notation, while classless interdomain routing, or CIDR (pronounced cider) method, is the official name. An address in classless addressing can thus be expressed as illustrated in the figure below."
"To put it another way, we must also provide the prefix length in classless addressing because an address does not automatically define the block or network to which it belongs."
"With respect to any given address in the block, we typically like to know three things: the number of addresses in the block, the start address in the block, and the last address. These three pieces of information, which are depicted in the picture below, are simple to locate because the prefix length, n, is known."
"The block has N = 232n addresses, according to the calculation."
"The n leftmost bits are kept, and the (32 - n) rightmost bits are all set to zeroes to determine the first address."
"The n leftmost bits are kept, while the (32 - n) rightmost bits are all set to 1s to determine the last address."
"For Example - The address 167.199.170.82/27 is a classless address. The following is where we can find the aforementioned three pieces of data. In the network, there are 232-n = 25 = 32 addresses in all."
The first 27 bits are kept while the remaining bits are converted to 0s to determine the first address.
Keeping the first 27 bits and turning the remaining bits to 1s will allow you to determine the last address.
"Quick Quiz - In the network 200.10.11.144/27, the fourth octet (in decimal) of the last IP address of the network, which can be assigned to a host is _____ (GATE 2015, 2 Marks)"
"Here, the maximum possible value of the last octet is 159 in decimal. Hence, the fourth octet of the last IP address, which can be assigned to a host is 10011110 in binary or 158 in decimal. Hence, the answer to the question is 158."
"IP addresses are divided into five groups using the classful addressing approach when they are assigned. In order to prevent the depletion of IP addresses, classless addressing is used. It is a method of IP address allocation that will eventually replace classful addressing."
"A further distinction is the usefulness of classful and classless addressing. Comparatively speaking, classless addressing is more beneficial and useful than classful addressing."
"In classful addressing, the network ID and host ID are adjusted according to the classes. However, the distinction between network ID and host ID does not exist with classless addressing. This opens up the possibility of making yet another contrast between both addressing."
"IP addressing includes two types: classful and classless. Classless addressing offers a more effective method of allocating IP addresses than classful addressing, which is the main difference between the two. To put it briefly, classless addressing prevents the issue of IP address exhaustion that can occur with classful addressing."
"Hello everyone. Today we are here for learning about differences between BOOTP and RARP in Computer Networking. Before learning about the differences, we need know about them. So, now let us learn about BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) in separate and also in detail."
"The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) are required because they mainly help us to connect to devices. They also help us to communicate between two or more devices or workstations. Regardless of differences in their working the reason why we use Network Protocols are they help us to communicate with people who may be anywhere in the world. Thus, these protocols play an important role in modern digital communications."
RARP - - - - > Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
DHCP - - - - > Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
TCP / IP - - - - > Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
IPv4 - - - - > Internet Protocol version 4
BIOS - - - - > Basic Input / Output System
Now let us learn about RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)
RARP is also known as Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. This protocol is used in Computer Networking. This is used by an employee who is using a computer owned by the client. They are using it request or get the Internet Protocol (IP) Address from cache or gateway server Address Resolution Protocol Table. RARP is used to find logical address of a machine which only has its own physical address. This logical address is differs from one machine to other machine. These logical addresses are never same and they never depend on machine hardware parts. The Internet Protocol (IP) Address is known from the file configuration present on a disk file.
This protocol is used to transmit data between two server-side sites. The client does not necessary need to be aware of the identity of the server before making a request. Administrators must configure each server individually for Medium Access Control (MAC) addresses. RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is very useful for providing IP addresses.
"The RARP client application requests an IP (Internet Protocol) address from the RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) server on the router when a replacement machine is set up since the machine may or may not have an associated disc that may permanently retain the IP Address. In the event that a router table entry has been configured, the RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) server will send the machine's IP address."
"The device can learn its physical address, which is specific to the area (by reading its NIC (Network Interface Card , for instance). The RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) protocol may then be used to obtain the logical address using the physical address. On the local network, a RARP request is generated and broadcast."
An additional device on the local network that is aware of every IP address will reply with a RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) answer. A RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) client software must be running on the requesting system; the RARP server software must be running on the replying system.
"Broadcasting occurs at the data connection layer, which is a severe flaw with RARP. The Physical broadcast addresses do not cross network borders, as is the case with Ethernet."
The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol was initialized in the year 1984. This Reverse Address Resolution Protocol is the protocol which is used to give the Internet Protocol (IP) Address to the server or desktop or computer etc. These server or desktop or computer etc can all be simply called as workstations.
"So, the simple diskless workstations are also the platform for the primary workstations from the company named Sun Microsystems."
The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol is used to transfer data between two sources or two client servers on the Network Access Layer. The sources have two different addresses. They are Internet Protocol (IP) Address and Media Access Control (MAC) Address.
The MAC address is then pre-programmed into the hardware once the IP address has been assigned by software.
"The RARP server, which responds to RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) requests, can be any standard computer that is connected to the network. However, it must record all MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that correspond to them. The network can only reply to RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) queries from these RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) servers. It is necessary to send the data packet through relatively low-cost network tiers. This means that each participant receives the package at the same time."
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is avails oneself for changing Ethernet Address to a simple Internet Protocol (IP) Address.
It is useful for Large Area Networks (LAN) derived technologies.
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) server should always be situated at the same physical network
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) cannot configure the Computer of a very modern network.
The computer uses a very fundamental network layer to transmit the RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) A router cannot transmit the packet because the computer sends the RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) request on the network's most fundamental layer.
"The RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is unable to control the sub netting process since no subnet masks are transmitted. If the network includes more than one subnet, each subnet must have access to a RARP server"
It doesn't fully use the potential of an Ethernet-style network.
These are reasons why The RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is not widely used now. The RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) has been replaced. It is replaced by Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
"Now, let us know why RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is obsolete"
"Here, obsolete means no longer useful. We already know that the RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) has been replaced. It was replaced by Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Let us know in detail why was it replaced."
Actually RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is widely used on Ethernet services. They were also extensively used in Token Rings Large Area Networks. RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is created for sending or providing Internet Protocol (IP) Address for other devices.
"As RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) was created to solely deliver Internet Protocol (IP) address information to devices that are either not statically allocated an Internet Protocol (IP) address or lack the internal storage space to keep one locally, it only provides a minimal service. From a Large Area Network (LAN) access standpoint, Bootstrap Protocol and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol have essentially replaced RARP. Both protocols are more feature-rich and scale well on contemporary Large Area Networks (LANs) with several IP subnets."
"However, RARP has returned to the workplace thanks to server and data center virtualization. For example, a crucial feature utilized for high-availability in the virtual machine is the capability to immediately shift a virtual server from one physical host to another, either inside the same physical data center or in another data center (VM)."
"BOOTP is also known as Bootstrap Protocol. This Protocol is used in Computer Networking. Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a protocol. This protocol works on the basis of internet. So, this is the reason why it is called as an Internet Protocol (IP). This is used for allowing the network user to receive an Internet Protocol (IP) Address. The network user immediately configures the received Internet Protocol (IP) Address. This lets the Booting of an Operating System to happen without external involvement or user collusion."
The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) requires a server to be executed. This server will be taken care by an Network Admin. This server is used for allowing the network user to receive an Internet Protocol (IP) Address. The network user immediately configures the received Internet Protocol (IP) Address. This lets the Booting of an Operating System to happen without external involvement or user collusion.
"The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) was actually introduced in 1985 because of Request for Comments 951 (also known as RFC 951) to replace Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). This Protocol requires servers to be present on the every server Internet Protocol (IP) Address. By using BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) , a central BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) server can exist for many sub nets."
"Today, BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is carried out via User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which forms the basis for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers handle client requests."
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is also known as a basic protocol
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) job is to create an unique Internet Protocol (IP) address for recognition and corroboration as soon as it is connected to the network. The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is very helpful as it speeds up the data transfer and connection requests.
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is an unique Internet Protocol (IP) algorithm. This algorithm helps in providing and creating new Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses and they are completely different and they also have no link between the previous created Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. The Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses are created very fast in a fraction of second.
This algorithm also helps to reduce the time required which is required for connection for source server and the client server.
"Now, the main and important processes like downloading and changing the already present values or codes are done. Even the small processes are also updated so that they would never cause problems in the near future."
"The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) connection requires Internet Protocol (IP) Address are required for the client server and the source server and they require a gateway address for get going of successful connection. In BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) Network the client and the source server use the same Large Area Network (LAN) , and the routers must support BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) So , for that routers are always kept under same networks"
"A great example of a TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) based network is the BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) network. To quickly respond to each request a computer on the network makes to the server, BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) utilizes its own IP address."
"Actually new network participant will not have an Internet Protocol (IP) Address. Then, the Network Admin who is the administrator of BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) gives access to the new network participant to host server. Now, the new network participant get a distinct or idiosyncratic Internet Protocol (IP) Address via IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) protocol."
The client or the new network participant installs the new BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) using TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) mode. This mode arbitration on the user workstation to ensure affinity with all the network protocols when connected to the certain network.
An appropriate unicast address is then included in a message that is sent by the BOOTP network administrator. The master server then forwards this unicast address to the BOOTP client.
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is required for system check purpose. The System is checked for a network when the computer is turned on
The motherboard and network management are able to efficiently organize the data transfer on the device as soon as it lights up since each computer on the network maintains track of its BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) cycle.
"BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is highly used for the support of usage of motherboards and mangers which work on Network. So, because of this protocol no other means storage is required other than cloud network."
"In order to send and receive requests and the networking server's suitable responses, a client and a server communicate using BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)."
BOOTP is typically used in a diskless environment and requires no media because all data is kept in the network cloud for effective utilization.
They do not have the concept of temporary Internet Protocol (IP) Addressing.
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) can also have irresolvable errors because of its configuration. This is because their configuration is manual.
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) does not support DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) cannot function for mobile phones and movable machines.
"This all about the RARP , BOOTP , and their differences in Computer Networks."
The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a parallel expansion card standard created to connect a video card to a computer system and help speed up 3D computer graphics. It was initially intended to replace video card connectors of the PCI kind. The point-to-point channel is utilized for high-speed output video. Graphic cards are connected to a computer's motherboard using this connection. It makes machines generate visuals more quickly while using the system's resources better. An AGP is primarily used to transmit 3-D images much more fluidly than is feasible on a standard PC.
"Compared to PCI, AGP offers substantially quicker connectivity and throughput. 3D graphics, high-definition gaming, and graphics for engineering and architecture are the main uses of an AGP. High-resolution video images can be created using the processors built into each graphic card. The connection between the video card and the computer's processor and memory often uses this port. Thanks to this connection, they can play video games with faster loading times and better graphics. The graphics card that helps the computer create video images is what is known as the video card, and it is attached to the computer. Because these cards can produce such images, they are used in games where players frequently engage in complex graphic play."
"In 1996, Intel created the AGP, which debuted in Socket 7 Intel P5 Pentium and Slot 1 P6 Pentium II processors. Early AGP boards were merely bridged to PCI-based graphics processors based on a peripheral component interconnect (PCI). Besides the enhanced 66 MHz bus frequency and the quadrupled bandwidth over PCI, bridging didn't do anything to help the cards take advantage of the new bus. It was stated that the PCI was the foundation upon which the AGP was developed."
"Early AGP sheets used processor designs that circumvented PCI and were essentially connected to AGP. As a result, the cards only benefited a little from the new transport. The 66 MHz transport clock, which multiplied data transmission through PCI and improved transport selectivity, was the key upgrade used. The AGPgart component module was initially executed in Linux in 1999, enabling AGP-enhanced rapid information movements."
"AGP uses a dedicated memory bus for graphics hardware, unlike PCIe technology, which was developed over a shared-memory design. AGP uses specific signaling that enables users to transport twice as much data through a port at the same clock speed. The rising edge of the clock, represented by the ""0"" to ""1"" transition signal, and the falling edge of the clock, represented by the ""0"" transition signal, are, therefore, when the bus sends data. It executes transitions using both signals, in contrast to standard PCI, which transfers data on separate transitions at each cycle."
"In the past, Intel offered the AGP hardware interface for attaching a graphics card (display adapter) to a computer. AGP was introduced in 1997 and replaced by PCI Express in the late 2000s. It directly connected the card and memory through a single motherboard slot. AGP was invented as a faster alternative to PCI, freeing up a PCI slot for another peripheral."
"AGP 1x, the initial AGP standard, offered a 264 MB/sec data transfer rate. The rate was increased by AGP 2x, 4x, and 8x to 528 MB/sec, 1 GB/sec, and 2 GB/sec."
"Nearer to the PCI slots, the brown AGP socket was located roughly one inch farther back. The motherboard only had one AGP slot available for the graphics card."
"PCI Express, a 16-channel bus, replaced the 32-bit AGP bus (PCIe). The graphics card was the only PCIe slot available on motherboards for a while. Later, boards have numerous PCIe slots available."
"Due to restricted or non-existent driver support, not all operating systems can handle AGP. For instance, AGP was not supported by Windows 95."
"Compared to a PCI, the features of an AGP enhanced its performance. These characteristics are nothing compared to the improvements made to the AGP design since its creation. The developments include"
"AGP slots have the capability of pipelining in computer architecture, which enables them to receive and process numerous instructions at once. The PCI does not have this feature because it can only accept (or) act on an instruction. Due to this feature, data transfer is improved."
"This AGP slot feature includes some extra data in the packet itself. Simply put, this extra information outlines the system for how and where the data should be used. It takes time because this feature needs to be included in POTS."
"Texture maps can be stored in the system memory thanks to this AGP capability. Since the storage is only available on the graphics card, this is not present in PCI. Due to the system memory's vast storage capacity and quick processing, high performance is attained."
AGP memory or non-local video memory is the name of this sort of memory. The ability of AGP to dynamically allocate RAM for usage by the graphics card enhances the process of storing texture maps. The number of texture maps that need to be saved on the graphics card's memory can be decreased by using the operating system's much faster and more plentiful RAM to store texture maps. The texture map size your computer can process is also no longer constrained by the graphics card's RAM capacity.
"AGP also reduces RAM use by only saving texture mappings once. It uses some deception to accomplish this. The Graphics Address Remapping Table chipset serves as the vehicle for this trick (GART). The portion of system memory that the AGP utilizes to keep texture maps for the graphics card is re-addressed by GART. Because of the new address that GART has provided, the CPU assumes that the texture map is kept in the card's frame buffer. The texture map may be scattered throughout the system RAM thanks to GART, yet when the CPU needs it, it is where it should be."
It is interconnected with the CPU and runs at processor bus speed.
It processes video information sent to the card more quickly.
It offers pipelining and sideband addressing as two ways for the graphics card to access texture maps stored in system memory directly.
The brown color of the port makes it easy to spot.
"It made it possible to create brand-new categories of PC programs, including 3D CAD/CAM, data visualization, and 3D user interfaces."
"Direct Memory execution of textures: The texture maps are directly acquired from the system memory rather than pre-loaded into the Graphic card's memory and then accessed. It prevents needless labor by enabling the texture to remain in system memory, where the graphics hardware may use it right away."
Creation of 3D images: The CPU is required to carry out complex 3D calculations. The graphics controller processes bitmaps and texture data. The controller frequently creates a single pixel on the screen by reading components from seven or eight separate textures. The pixel needs to be kept in the memory buffer before this computation is done. These textures take up so much memory that they can't be kept in the video card's buffer. They are kept in the primary system memory while using APG.
"AGP Pro was introduced in 1998 as an AGP interface extension specification for powerful workstations. It includes a bigger slot and extra voltage pins for 3D video cards with high power requirements. The graphics device and memory are connected directly, thanks to the AGP Pro bus specification. The AGP Pro is backward compatible with the AGP bus's earlier iterations."
"AGP Pro slots can provide powerful high-end workstation graphics cards with greater power. AGP Pro offers an expanded connector, thermal envelope, revised mechanical standards, and I/O bracket in addition to providing more power to video cards. AGP Pro slots are a little longer than those in regular AGP."
"AGP Pro is a physical specification designed to meet the demands of premium graphics card makers, who are currently constrained by the maximum amount of electrical power that an AGP card may require (about 25W). AGP Pro uses a slightly longer AGP slot that can accommodate current AGP cards and is designed to accommodate cards that draw up to 100W."
It has a clock speed of 66 MHz and the speed of two times more than normal. The transfer rate for AGP 1.0 is around 266MB/s to 533 MB/s.
It has a clock speed of 66 MHz and a speed four times more than normal. The transfer rate for AGP 2.0 is around 1066MB/s.
It has a clock speed of 66 MHz and a speed eight times that of normal. The transfer rate for AGP 3.0 is around 2133 MB/s.
"AGP works on a clock speed of 66 MHz, and PCI works on a 33MHz clock speed."
"AGP has no local memory, and it accesses the video directly from the system memory. In contrast, PCI has its own local memory, and it accesses the video from the card's memory."
"AGP gets the data simultaneously, which makes it fast and smoother, but PCI receives data in groups, so it is relatively slower."
"AGP has a data transfer rate of around 2133MB/s, whereas PCI has a speed of 132MB/s."
"AGP makes multiple requests for the data while accessing the memory, whereas PCI does not make any data request until it receives the previously requested data."
"AGP has a pipelined structure for the data, but PCI does not form any pipelined structure."
"AGP provides direct communication to the CPU and Main Memory which helps in the quick rendering of graphics. PCI was relatively slower, so it was designed to replace the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)."
"Texture maps of countless sizes, levels of detail, and realism can be used."
"3D applications will function more quickly when there is no longer a need to pre-fetch and cache textures in local video memory with more frames per second, up to 12.6 times more."
AGP assists OEMs in keeping costs under control for new PC designs by reducing the requirement for video RAM.
Video traffic will flow smoothly to the user's screen across the AGP bus.
Systems will operate more steadily by removing graphics and video traffic from the PCI bus.
"We occasionally see some intriguing lights travelling gradually and in a linear fashion through the night sky without blinking or sparkling. It could be a satellite. There are many distinct sorts of satellites that orbit or travel around a planet or star. The moon is an innate example of a satellite in view of the fact that it spins around the Earth. However, in most instances, when individuals refer to satellites, they refer to manufactured objects sent into orbit."
"Satellites orbit the Earth like spacecraft and are typically equipped with a computer and solar panels that draw power from the Sun. In 1957, a satellite was launched into orbit for the first time. It was named as Sputnik and was roughly the size of a ball. Tons of satellites are currently present in the sky. They occasionally also have cameras or other research gear to aid data collection."
"Let's examine in greater detail what satellite communication is, how they operate, what they are employed for, and their benefits and drawbacks in this post."
Any entity that orbits a planet in a curved route is considered a satellite. Another way to think of a satellite is as a tiny object in space that orbits a bigger one.
"When it comes to categorizing satellites, there are two main categories:"
"Natural Satellite
Natural satellites are natural objects that orbit other, larger natural objects in space. For instance, the moon of the Earth is a natural satellite, as are the planets which orbit the Sun. It moves in a predetermined orbit around the Sun."
"Artificial Satellite
Artificial satellites are created by humans and put into motion employing rockets."
Disseminating data between two or more entities via any stream or channel is communication.
Satellite communication is the term that encompasses any communication that incorporates different ground stations and a satellite.
Ground wave propagation and sky wave transmission were the two techniques of propagation traditionally used for telecommunication.
The combined distance that the two of them can travel is 1500 kilometres.
"This restriction is addressed through satellite communication. Longer-distance communication can be accomplished with it, even beyond the line of sight."
"In 1945, renowned British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke came to believe in satellite communication."
"We notice that the general communication process is split into two portions, with the uplink being the portion of the process when information is transferred to the satellite."
"The second phase, known as downlink, occurs while the satellite is retransmitting and another earth station intercepts the data or signal."
The data is streamed at a distinctive frequency from the frequency at which it is retrieved at the earth station.
Information is sent over the uplink at frequency f1 and received over the downlink at frequency f2.
The following are the two fundamental satellite communication system segments:
"Ground section:

It consists of the following items: the earth station, user terminals and interface, broadcast and receive devices, and antenna systems."
"It consists of the following items: the earth station, user terminals and interface, broadcast and receive devices, and antenna systems."
"Space section:

It consists of a launch vehicle, a satellite, a communication transponder, a communication antenna, and an electrical power system."
"It consists of a launch vehicle, a satellite, a communication transponder, a communication antenna, and an electrical power system."
"There will be a satellite, two earth stations (earth stations 1 and 2), and other equipment."
"With the help of a high-directional dish antenna, an earth station transmits information to the satellite."
"The uplink, or transmission of data to the satellite, is being made by earth station 1."
Earth Station 2 (sometimes referred to as the downlink) receives data from the satellite.
"The uplink frequency is the frequency at which data is broadcast, while the downlink frequency is the frequency at which earth station 2 gathers input from the satellite."
"Typically, the uplink frequency and the downlink frequency are maintained separately."
"The satellite transponder changes this signal to a different frequency and is transmitted to earth station 2.

Transponders are the engines of communication satellites.
The transponder's primary duties include changing the frequency of the input signals, eliminating sound output, and increasing the transmission quality.
The transponder requires a significant amount of electrical energy to accomplish these tasks.
The satellites can use batteries or solar panels to deliver electricity.
A solar panel fuels the electronic devices, but batteries are employed during the eclipse.
A sun sensor is also seen on the satellite. The photovoltaic cells may be oriented correctly to capture the most energy from the Sun with the aid of these sun detectors.
Reflector antennas constitute the most prominent type of antenna mounted to satellites.
A satellite is contemplated to advance in the direction of its designated orbit.
The gravitational field surrounding the satellite is not consistent because of the uneven mass distribution of the planet, as well as the influence of the moon and the Sun.
As a result, the satellite may occasionally be knocked off its orbital position.
The result of this is a total signal loss.
Satellites employ thrusters to avoid these scenarios.
The satellite is kept in the proper position by the thrusters.
The reservoirs in the satellite housing store the fuel required for the thrusters.
An earth station routinely helps to keep track of the satellite's location.
The earth station also assesses the condition and pace of the satellites."

"An orbit is a periodic, repetitive trajectory that an entity in space takes to round another entity."
"Equatorial orbit:

An equatorial orbit is one in which the satellite travels along a trajectory that is primarily spherical and revolves just above the equator.
It has a zero-degree inclination."
An equatorial orbit is one in which the satellite travels along a trajectory that is primarily spherical and revolves just above the equator.
"Inclined orbit:

All trajectories are tilted, excluding those that pass directly over the Northern and Southern hemispheres or the centre.
The inclination angle ranges from zero to 180 degrees."
"All trajectories are tilted, excluding those that pass directly over the Northern and Southern hemispheres or the centre."
"Polar orbit:

A polar orbit emerges when a satellite spins in an orbital arrangement perpendicular to the equatorial plane and crosses both the North and South poles.
Polar-orbiting satellites go over and very close to the North and South poles on a low-altitude path close to the earth's surface.
A spacecraft in a polar orbit is inclined at a nearly 90-degree angle."

The Earth's orbit completes in 90 to 120 minutes."
These satellites orbit between 160 and 2000 kilometres above the planet's surface.
"Medium Earth orbit:

It refers to the space surrounding the Earth, above the geostationary orbit, and underneath the low earth orbit.
A medium earth orbit satellite's orbital period might be between two and six hours.
This satellite orbits the Earth between 2000 and 35,786 kilometres beyond the surface."

It is positioned immediately over the equator at about 35,786 kilometres.
It rotates in the exact orientation of the Earth's rotational axis, west to east.
The orbit of this spacecraft around the planet takes 24 hours."
"It is positioned immediately over the equator at about 35,786 kilometres."
"It rotates in the exact orientation of the Earth's rotational axis, west to east."
The orbit of this spacecraft around the planet takes 24 hours.
"Spherical orbit:

The circle-shaped trajectory revolves at a given distance from the barycentre.
The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.
Different kinds of circular orbits exist. They consist of the following:

Geosynchronous orbitPolar orbit
Equatorial sphere"
The circle-shaped trajectory revolves at a given distance from the barycentre.
"Different kinds of circular orbits exist. They consist of the following:

Geosynchronous orbitPolar orbit

"Elliptical orbit:

An elliptical orbit is the movement of one object around another along a route with an oval shape.
The orbits with an eccentricity higher than 0 but much less than 1.
These satellites are occasionally closer to the Earth and occasionally farther away.
A satellite's perigee is the point at which it approaches nearest to Earth.
The Apogee is the furthest location."

The orbits with an eccentricity higher than 0 but much less than 1.
These satellites are occasionally closer to the Earth and occasionally farther away.
A satellite's perigee is the point at which it approaches nearest to Earth.
It is a well-known fact that the satellite stays in orbit because of the balance between gravitational pull and centrifugal force.
The angular velocity of the satellite is decided by the force balance equation that balances the gravitational and centrifugal forces.
"When the satellite is deployed, it is given sufficient speed to balance these two forces."
A satellite near to earth requires more speed to resist the gravitational pull than the ones located further from the earth.
"Due to the negligible resistance in space, satellites never loose speed. This means satellites will continue their circular motion around the earth without any external energy source."
"Satellites are places either in low earth orbit, medium earth orbit or geo-synchronous orbit."
"The decision on what orbit is to be chosen for placing the satellites will depend on the application and purpose of the satellite.

If it is built for earth observation like weather forecasting, geographic area surveying, satellite phone calls etc, then orbits closer to the earth are chosen.
Low earth orbit is the closest to the earth and hence is chosen for these applications.
But these types of satellite cover very less area and hence more satellites are required to provide a better coverage."

Low earth orbit is the closest to the earth and hence is chosen for these applications.
But these types of satellite cover very less area and hence more satellites are required to provide a better coverage.
"In case of broadcasting, a high orbit such as geo-synchronous orbit are chosen."
"For navigation application such as GPS, Medium earth orbits are the wise option."
The location of an entity on the surface is identified via a satellite navigation system.
"It establishes the precise position of any object, including warships, planes, and other vehicles."
It is frequently employed as a military tool or to acquire data for military reasons.
The following are the main satellite navigation systems: The Global Navigation Satellite System is the name of the global navigational system (GNSS)
"The United States first introduced the Global Positioning System, or GPS, satellite technology."
"The main purposes of the weather satellite are:

To keep an eye on earth's environment and weather.
The ability to forecast everyday meteorological conditions like temperature and rainfall.
To keep track of the growth and evolution of meteorological phenomena such as storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and tropical storms."

"To keep track of the growth and evolution of meteorological phenomena such as storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and tropical storms."
"A communication satellite is a spacecraft that sends signals across vast distances, including phone, television, radio, and internet transmissions."
A satellite is placed into orbit by a two-step process:
The satellite must first be elevated to the required altitude before launching at the proper velocity to start and maintain its orbit.
A launch vehicle (such as a rocket or a space shuttle) is used to place a satellite in orbit around the planet.
"During take-off and the initial stages of flight, the boosters propel the rocket with its initial thrust."
"The rocket disintegrates, and the other boosters take over as the fuel in the boosters runs out."
Only the initial seconds of a launch vehicle's flight are spent flying straight up.
The vehicle becomes lighter and can move faster as each booster is released. It releases the satellite into orbit once it has attained the required altitude and speed.
Every region of the earth can be accessed via satellite communication.
"Irrespective of the distance, information may be transmitted and collected."
The process of placing a satellite into orbit is expensive.
Satellite systems have a longer propagation delay than typical terrestrial systems.
The effectiveness of the satellites in transmitting information is decreased by significant delay.
Challenging to rectify if a satellite system encounters any issues.
High-strength and large-diameter transmitters are needed for satellite communication transmitters and receivers.
The effectiveness of the satellite component declines as a result of aging.
Every device connected to a network that implements the Internet protocol has a unique identification address assigned to it. This identification address is known as the IP Address. The collection of this interconnected network is referred to as the internet.
"Sometimes, you see an IP Address for a device from outside the network. The device's IP Address may look different from what was assigned in the subnetwork. This is due to a mechanism called NAT. This different-looking IP Address from outside the network is an External IP Address."
"The external IP Address, also known as the Public IP Address, is the address assigned to the router interface connected to the internet."
Let's see a diagram to understand how an IP Address is allocated to a device in a home or small network.
The router connecting the device to the internet generally has two network interfaces. These two interfaces are referred as:
"A unique IP address is assigned to both the interface of the router. The IP address assigned to the internal interface is the internal IP Address. In contrast, the IP Address assigned to the router's external interface is known as the External IP Address. The External IP Address is routable and is usually assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This address is also known as a Public IP Address."
The External IP Address is ranged. The range determines the functioning of the device. The range of public addresses is assigned to the Internet Service Provider by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
A special range of Internal IP addresses is assigned for a home or home office network that uses a NAT router to connect to the internet.
"NAT router is used to connect thousands of devices, such as computers, laptops, or mobile phones, all connected to an internal network in accessing the internet by using a single external IP Address to all the devices in the subnetwork."
"A particular range of addresses is reserved for internal addresses . the routers on the internet do not share the IP addresses within this range. Therefore, internal addresses are also known as Private addresses. They are exclusive to a private network."
"For example, all the devices at my home have an internal address in this format, 192.168.1.x, but the external address for the same device is 109.155.209.165."
The home networks have an address that ranges between 192.168.0.*-192.168.1.*. This network range is nonroutable. This range is only used for private addresses exclusively. This is one of many ranges that are used by home networks. They can also use the following address ranges:
172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x: The given range provides a 20-bit block address.
It is simpler to find the external IP address of the device. The external IP Address is routable and is available on the internet. You can find the IP address using a simple Google search query.
"Just open the browser, and type my IP Address, and your IP will be displayed in the following manner."
Open the command and line in your system and write a simple command:
"Thus, the internal IP Address of your system is 192.168.1.64, which is different from the external IP Address of the device."
The internal IP Address is available to the local devices and network. The external IP Address is used to facilitate communication with the devices available on the internet.
"It is not possible with a NAT router to establish a direct link between the internet and a device on the local network. So, any communication with the internet must be initiated by your device on the local network. This is not a problem, but it provides a solution to the security concerns associated with the internet."
"However, the players who play online games, especially those that enable the user to play with other users online. The website that hosts these games provides Access to the external device on the internet. To provide Access to the external IP Address to the internet, the NAT router is configured using a method known as port forwarding. This technique allows the device on the local network to have an additional IP Address that allows the users to establish incoming connections from the internet."
"In-home and small business networks, the network uses a private IP Address known as the internal IP address that is only visible to devices connected to the particular sub-network. This address lies in a special non routable address range."
A NAT router is responsible for establishing a connection between the internal network and the internet using the external IP address assigned to all the devices on a local network by the Internet Service Provider.
An external network can't connect with the local network unless the user employs techniques such as port forwarding. The NAT router enables the user to establish the connection initiated by the internal network to the external network.
"We use an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network because it is driven by the integration of performance and service, which is the requirement for both data network and telephony. It also provides network support for the single quality of the service, and these services are very expensive. It is very cheap and flexible. It also supports some ranges of services at a reasonable cost."
"Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an International Telecommunication Union- Telecommunications Standards Section (ITU-T) that is very efficient for the relay of calling. Also, it is used to transfer all the services like voice, data, or video. These services can be conveyed in a small fixed-sized packet called the cell. These cells are connected in a network that transmits the data asynchronously."
"Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is a technology that was developed in the year between 1970 and 1980. This was considered the revolution in packet switching. Each cell consists of 53 bytes longs. Further, the 53 bytes long can be divided into 5 bytes header and 48 bytes payload. Before making an ATM call, we need to send a message to set up the connection."
All the cells follow the same path connected to the destination. The cell can also handle both variable and constant rate traffic. Thus it has multiple types of traffic with end-to-end encryption. Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) does not depend on the transmission medium. Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) uses cell or packet switching and virtual circuits to switch the transmission medium. The main purpose of designing the Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is to help implement high-performance multimedia networking.
"In Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), the data are transmitted through a fixed-size unit called cells. As we know, each cell has 53 bytes long. There are two types of Asynchronous transfer modes (ATM). These are as follows:"
This is used in the private connection in the Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network between ATM switches and ATM endpoints.
"Two types of connection use the Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). A virtual path can be created end-to-end across an ATM network, as it does not route the cells to a particular virtual circuit. In case of major failure, all cells belonging to a particular virtual path are routed the same way through the ATM network, thus helping faster recovery."
"Switches connected to subscribers use both VPIs and VCIs to switch the cells, which are Virtual Path and Virtual Connection switches that can have different virtual channel connections between them, serving the purpose of creating a virtual trunk between the switches, which can be handled as a single entity. Its basic operation is straightforward looking up the connection value in the local translation table, determining the outgoing port of the connection, and the new VPI/VCI value of the connection on that link."
"ATM is a ""virtual circuit"" based: Here, the path is reserved before transmission. While Internet Protocol (IP) is connectionless, end-to-end resource reservations are impossible. RSVP is a new signaling protocol on the internet."
"ATM Cells: Fixed or small, and the Tradeoff is between voice or data. At the same time, IP packets are of variable size."
"Addressing: ATM uses 20-byte global NSAP addresses for signaling and 32-bit locally assigned labels in cells. At the same time, IP uses 32-bit global addresses in all packets."
"To send the data over a long distance, we use WAN and a router to connect ATMs and other networks."
"It helps manage ATM, LAN, voice, and video services and is capable of full-service virtual private networking, including integrated multimedia access."
Frame relay services are a networking infrastructure for a range of data services and enable frame-relay ATM service to Internetworking services.
ATM by choice provides the networking infrastructure for establishing residential broadband services in search of highly scalable solutions.
To make more effective use of SONET/SDH fiber infrastructures we build the ATM infrastructure to carry out the telephonic and private-line traffic.
"When we develop software, our first and most important priority is user authentication. To authenticate the user there are several mechanisms by which we can authenticate the data that are given by the user. In this article, we are going to learn the most common types of the authentication protocol and their advantages and disadvantages."
"Requiring users to provide and prove their identity adds a layer of security between adversaries and sensitive data. With authentication, IT teams can employ the least privileged access to limit what employees can see. The average employee, for example, doesn't need access to company financials, and accounts payable doesn't need to touch developer projects. When selecting an authentication type, companies must consider UX along with security. Some user authentication types are less secure than others, but too much friction during authentication can lead to poor employee practices."
Kerberos is a type of protocol that is used to authenticate users. It validates the client and server during networking with the help of a cryptographic key. It is designed to strongly authenticate the users during the reporting of the application. All the proposals of Kerberos are available at MIT. The main use of the Kerberos is in the product-based companies.
"In Kerberos, the authentication key is shared very efficiently in comparison to public sharing."
The client and service can only authenticate themselves with the help of Kerberos.
"When we use a soft or weak password, it always shows vulnerability."
"LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. With the help of this protocol, we can determine the organization, individual, or any other devices during the networking over the internet. It is also called a Directory as a service. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the ground for Microsoft Building Activity Directory."
It is a type of automated protocol that is why it is very easier for the organization.
All the existing software is supported by Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).
Multiple directories can be allowed in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)
The directory servers are required to be LDAP-obedient for deployment.
"OAuth2 is a type of authentication protocol for the framework. It provides permission to the users which are coming through the HTTP servers. When the user makes a request to access the resources, suddenly, an API call is created, and after that, the authentication token is generated."
"It is a very simple type of authentication protocol, and it is very easy to use."
It is a little bit difficult to manage the different sets of codes.
"When we connect it to an affected system, it also shows some serious effects."
SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. It is based on an XML-based authentication protocol. It provides authorization between the service provider and the identity provider. It is also a product of the OASIS Security Service Technical Committee.
The administrative cost is reduced for the end user with the help of SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).
It provides a single window for authentication for all the services.
"RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. It is a type of network protocol that provides accounting, centralized authentication, and authorization. When the user makes a request to access all the resources, the RADIUS server creates a temporary credential to access all the resources. After this, the temporary credential is saved on the local database and provides access to the user."
It has a feature to provide multiple accesses to the admin.
It also provides a unique id for every session of the user.
The mechanism for initial implementation is very hard on hardware.
It has a variety of models that may require a special team which is cost-consuming.
The CISCO packet tracker was developed by the CISCO Company. It is a type of tool that provides the simulator to practice simple and complex networks. The main purpose of the CISCO pocket tracker is to help the student for the purpose of learning hand on experience in networking. It also provides specific skills for CISCO technology. This tool cannot replace the router or switch because this software has some inbuilt protocol. The interesting thing is that this device has not only the CISCO product but also it has some inbuilt networking support.
"This tool also facilitates some technical concepts like CCENT and CCNA, where the packet utilizes all the technical concepts and networking systems."
"This packet also helps the student to complete their assignment by working on their own or working with a team. It also helps the engineer to test their application before implementing them. Also, the engineers who work on network support can also deploy any changes also use the CISCO packet. First, the engineers test the changes they want to make. Then if all the changes worked perfectly, the packet proceeded toward deployment of the test."
"With the help of this packet tracker, it is very easier for all the engineers to add or remove any simulated network devices. We can perform these operations in two steps. One is drag and drop user interface, and another is the command line interface."
"The logical workspace shows the logical network topology that is built by the user. It displays the connecting, placing, and clustering of virtual network devices."
"In the physical workspace, we can see the physical implementation of the logical network. It also shows how the network devices such as switches, routers, and hosts are connected in a real network topology."
"CISCO Packet Tracer is a free tool for members of the CISCO Networking Academy. Those who aren't members of this academy have to enroll in one of their Packet Tracer courses. Once done, you can download the Tracer using the following steps:"
There are some features that are provided by the CISCO packet tracker. These are as follows:
"CISCO packet tracker supports the multi-user system that allows any user to connect in different topologies across different computer networks. By using this feature, the teacher assigns different tasks to different students."
We can also remove the capabilities of the CISCO packet tracker with the help of an API. This feature is also provided by the CISCO packet tracker.
"We can also remove the special features like accessibility, gaming, assessment delivery, and interaction with the real world from the CISCO packet tracker."
We can download this from the Netacad account for free of cost.
"We can also simulate the configuration related to routers, and this can be accessed anywhere."
"The Enhanced Physical Mode transports you to a virtual lab where you can simulate cabling devices on a rack. Refresh key skills such as device placement (Rack & Stack), on-device power switching, device port-to-port cabling (including cable selection and management), troubleshooting, and more."
"The Network Controller allows you a centralized dashboard to see the network's state, instantly discover and diagnose issues, and push configuration changes to all managed devices at once, whether you use its Web GUI or its APIs. You may also use real-world programs on your computer to access the Network Controller and run your infrastructure automation scripts."
"Today, we are going to learn how a BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) works. Before, entering the topic named How does BOOTP works, let us know a little about BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and its history too."
Bootstrap Protocol is another name for BOOTP. Utilized in computer networking is this protocol. A protocol is the Bootstrap Protocol. The Internet serves as the foundation for this protocol. This therefore explains why it is referred to as an Internet Protocol (IP). The network user can use this to get an Internet Protocol (IP) address. The network user quickly configures the IP address they just obtained. This enables the booting of an operating system to take place without interference from the outside world or user cooperation.
The BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) has to be run on a server. A network administrator will be responsible for this server. An Internet Protocol (IP) Address can be obtained by the network user through the usage of this service.
The network user quickly configures the IP address they just obtained. This enables an operating system to boot without interference from the outside world or user cooperation.
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) was replaced by the BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) in 1985 as a result of Request for Comments 951 (also known as RFC 951). Every server must have a server present on its Internet Protocol (IP) address in order for this protocol to work. A central BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) server can be established for many subnets by using the BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) protocol.
"UDP, the predecessor to Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is used today to carry out the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). Client requests are managed by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers."
"When a BOOTP client first starts up, it does not know its IP address or the IP address of the BOOTP server. As a result, it broadcasts a message across the network that contains its MAC address."
"A ""BOOTREQUEST,"" also referred to as a general broadcast message, is sent to the broadcast address. When the request is received, the server listening on UDP port 67 processes it by allocating an IP address to the client's MAC (Media Access Control) address."
"The ""BOOTREPLY"" request, which includes network information and is delivered back to the client through broadcast, is what it responds to the client with. It contains the following information:"
"IP address (ciaddr and yiaddr), subnet mask, and default gateway address (giaddr) of the client."
The server's IP address where the boot image is located.
"It first obtains the information from the BOOTP server, initializes and configures the TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) stack, and then establishes a connection to the server hosting the boot image. Finally, the client loads the image and launches its Operating System (OS) using the data."
"System checks require the BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol). When the computer is turned on, the System is examined for a network."
"Since each computer on the network keeps track of its own BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) cycle, the motherboard and network management are able to efficiently organize the data flow on the device as soon as it turns on."
"The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is widely used to facilitate the use of motherboards and managers that operate over a network. Therefore, thanks to this protocol, just a cloud network is needed for storage."
A client and a server must connect in order to send and receive requests and the networking server's appropriate answers must communicate using BOOTP.
"In this tutorial, we will learn about Subnetting in Computer Networks Subject. First and foremost, the most crucial concept we are going to learn today is that while studying the subject of computer networks is subnetting. The most crucial idea known as Subnetting will help to lessen or disperse the pressure that the networks' heavy load causes. Let's now quickly go through the idea of subnetting for everyone."
"Now, let us know the definition of Subnetting. But before going into the Subnetting concept let us know the overview of the concept named Subnetting in Computer Networks."
Subnetting is a part of Network Layer. The duty of the network layer is to divide the received message into separate components and activities. The Network layer can be called as the heart of Computer Networks.
Finding a network and delivering data to it was simpler when the IP (Internet Protocol) system was initially implemented since there were fewer individuals online. Sending a data packet to the desired machine in a network is getting more and more challenging these days due to the rise in internet users. Network performance becomes a major issue once a network is large enough to serve an enterprise.
"In order to divide larger networks logically (firewalls, etc.) or physically (for example), an organization can employ IP subnets (smaller broadcast domains, etc.). To put it another way, routers base their routing choices on subnets. We shall learn more about these ideas in this post."
Subnetting is a combination of two words i.e. Sub and Netting. Here Sub word means Substitute and netting word means Network. The Substitute Network created for a function to happen is known as Subnetting.
"Here, Substitute Network does not mean a new network is created. A full piece of network is broken into small pieces and each piece a different is assigned."
Subnet is the name given to piece of the broken network or can also be called as the Substitute network is known as Subnet. Subnets are the legal small parts of IP (Internet Protocol) Addressing process
Subnetting should be done in such a way that network does not gets affected. This means that we can divide the network into different parts but all when put together should perform the same task when done before splitting in to small parts.
"Subnets reduce the need for traffic to use unnecessary routes, which speeds up the network. To help with the lack of IP addresses on the internet, subnets were developed"
"Subnetting is a technique for creating logical sub-networks from a single physical network (subnets). A company can grow its network via subnetting without asking for a new network number from its ISP. Subnetting hides network complexity while assisting in the reduction of network traffic. Here, a network which is unique has to provide its services to many Local Area Networks i.e. (LAN). So, for this reason Subnetting is extensively used."
"Do you know what these little subnets are? As we all know, subnetting divides networks into them. A subnet is a smaller network, also referred to as a sub network. An IP network is logically divided into several smaller network components by subnets. A subnet is used to divide a large network into a number of smaller, linked networks, which helps to minimize traffic. Subnets reduce the need for traffic to use unnecessary routes, which speeds up the network. To help with the lack of IP addresses on the internet, subnets were developed."
"A rapid, effective, and reliable computer network is what subnetting is meant to create. Network traffic must find more effective routes as they become larger and more complicated. If all network traffic used the same path and moved through the system at once, bottlenecks and congestion would form, creating sluggish and inefficient backlogs. You may reduce the number of routers that network traffic must transit through by setting up a subnet. In order to make traffic go the shortest distance feasible inside a bigger network, an engineer will effectively create smaller mini routes."
"By removing the need for extra routers, subnetting makes network traffic simpler. This makes sure the data being transmitted can get to its destination as fast as possible, eliminating or avoiding any potential diversions that may slow it down."
"By isolating or removing vulnerable network regions and making it harder for intruders to move through a company's network, subnetting helps the network managers in reducing network-wide risks."
"Each class has a finite amount of possible host allocations; for instance, networks with more than 254 devices require a Class B allocation. Assume that you are a network administrator. Now, you have a task of allocating 150 hosts among three physical networks in three distinct cities for a Class B or C network. If so, we must either ask for additional address blocks for each network or split the single big network into small parts named subnets so that we could utilize a single address block across a number of physical networks."
We will learn about this concept deeper in the upcoming topics.
"Placing all of the computers on the same subnet can assist minimize network traffic if a significant amount of an organization's traffic is intended to be shared routinely among a number of devices. Without a subnet, all computers and servers on the network would be able to see data packets from every other machine."
"The main network is divided into smaller subnets through the process of subnetting, and the goal of these smaller, linked networks is to split the large network into a collection of smaller, less-busy networks. Subnets reduce the need for traffic to use unnecessary routes, which speeds up the network."
An IP address is split into its network address and host address via subnetting.
"The split address may then be further divided into units using the subnet mask approach, and those units can be assigned to different network devices."
"Here, X refers to the Host ID. This is the only thing which gets changed in the Internet Protocol Address"
"Now, we are going to learn how these subnets provide the different addresses to different devices and also the process of subnetting in computer networks. So, by this example we would easily understand the working of the Subnet."
We are going to learn how Subnets are formed for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Addressing.
The total number of Internet Protocol Addresses (IP Address) gives the total number of Subnets that can be formed by using a network.
The number of usable IP Addresses that can be created is
"We have arrived at the subject at hand, Subnetting, thanks to the problem of IP address waste. By taking bits from the Host ID section of the address, subnetting enables the creation of smaller networks (sub networks; subnets) within of a larger network. With the help of those borrowed bits, we can build more networks with a reduced overall size."
A Subnet is created from the bits taken from the Host ID.
To understand about this concept let take an example of a network this belongs to class C.
Our goal is to create to build a network. The capacity of each network must be Thirty (30) Devices. We have three networks of type Class C Network based on IPv4 Addressing.
Each Class C Network can provide Two Hundred and Fifty Four (254) Internet Protocol Addresses.
The Capacity of each device which we require is very less than the Capacity which we require.
"So, now we divide the four networks based on the requirement. Let us see how this division happens."
We have four Class C Networks of imaginary Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses like:
We know that each network can produce 254 IP Addresses alone. This means four networks can produce 254 * 4 = 1016 (Thousand and Sixteen ) Internet Protocol Addresses can be formed. But what we require is only thirty Internet Protocol Addresses from each Network. This means we only need hundred and Twenty (120) IP Addresses only.
"Eight Hundred and Ninety-Six Addresses created are wasted. So, we need to use the Host ID bits wisely."
"So, by some calculation we will get to know that if we take 5 bits from each network we will be able to get 30 IP Addresses from each Network."
"So, by considering we can create 30 Usable IP Addresses from each Class C Network."
"So, now we have 3 more Host ID Bits left over unused. We also have different ways in using these remaining bits."
"These remaining Host ID Bits can be used to increase the capacity of the IP Addresses to be created in future, if required."
We can also create a new six subnets from each network using these three Host ID Bits.
First method is usually chosen because creation of two different subnets causes wastage of IP Addresses. Let me explain this problem with the help of the above example.
"Subnetting, as we all know, separates the network into small subnets. While each subnet permits communication between the devices connected to it, subnets are connected together by routers. The network technology being utilized and the connectivity requirements define the size of a subnet. Each organization is responsible for selecting the number and size of the subnets it produces, within the constraints of the address space available for its use."
"For the construction of the subnets, we usually check the MSB (Most Significant Bit) bits of the host ID and if found wrong we make it right. In order to create two network subnets, we fix one of the host's MSB (Most Significant Bit) bits in the table below. We are unable to alter network bits since doing so would alter the entire network."
"We need a subnet mask to identify a subnet, which is created by substituting the number ""1"" for each Network ID bit and the amount of bits we reserve for Host ID to create the subnet. A data packet from the internet is intended to be forwarded to the specified subnet network using the subnet mask."
"A part of an address should be used as the Subnet ID is also specified by the subnet mask. In order to apply the subnet mask to the whole network address, a binary AND operation is utilized. When performing an AND operation, it is assumed that the result will be ""true"" if both inputs are. If not, ""false"" is presented. This is only possible when both bits are 1."
The Subnet ID results from this. The Subnet ID is used by routers to choose the best route among the sub - networks.
"The two components that make up an IP address are the Network Prefix (sometimes called the Network ID) and the Host ID. Depending on whether the address is Class A, B, or C, either the Network Prefix or the Host ID must be separated. A Class B IPv4 address, 172.16.37.5, is seen in the image below. The Network Prefix is 172.16.0.0, and the Host ID is 37.5."
We use permutations to the amount of bits set aside to form subnets if we wish to produce subnets of varied length. Variable Length Subnet Masking is the name of this subnetting (VLSM).
"After setting aside some bits to indicate the subnet, the broadcast address of a subnet is computed by setting all the remaining bits of the host id to 1.The message is sent to all network hosts using the broadcast address."
Subnetting is used to decrease the presence of Internet Protocol (IP) range.
"Subnets helps in stopping the devices or gadgets from occupying the whole network, only allowing the hosts to control which kind of user can have access to the important information. Simply, we can tell that network is safe just because of the subnetting concept."
Subnetting concept increases the performance of the total network by deleting the repeated traffic causing errors.
We can convert the whole big network into smaller networks by using the concept of subnetting as discussed earlier.
"If the number of subnets increases, then the number of routers must also increase along with the subnet increase number. This happens because each subnet has its own subnet mask, broadcast address and network address."
"As told earlier, if we create many subnets many IP Addresses are wasted because of the wastage of Host ID Bits"
"The cost of the entire network is increased by subnetting, which calls for the acquisition of pricey internal routers, switches, hubs, and bridges, among other things."
The complexity of the network is increased through subnetting. The subnet network must be managed by a skilled network administrator.
This is all about Subnetting Concept in the subject named Computer Networks.
"To understand the advantages and disadvantages, first we have to know what is Mesh Topology? So, let's begin with introduction."
It is a type of network setup in which all the devices and computers are interconnected. We have been able to achieve a full or partial connection with the help of mesh topology.
"We needed to find out the structure of mesh topology. For some reason, we can connect most of the transmission as the distributed system if one connection fails. This topology is an example of how the wireless network works currently."
"When a connection is completed, and all the computers are connected, we can calculate the number of connections with a specific type of formula. But when a parcel connection exists, we have to connect at least two computers to multiple devices. It is an excellent way to implement primary connections without thinking about any computer failing to operate and disrupting the connection."
There are two types of Mesh topologies which are mentioned below:
"All the nodes within the network are connected with every other. If there are n number of nodes are connected during a network transmission, each node will have an n-1 number of connections."
"The partial mesh is more practical as compared to the full mesh. In a partially connected mesh, all the nodes aren't necessary to be connected with one another during a network."
Some of the advantages and disadvantages of mesh topology connection are given below:
There are some advantages or benefits of mesh topology which are described below:
"There is no hierarchical relationship exists between mesh topology. For instance, let us consider a device that is connected to it and attempts to contact any other one by directly taking advantage of the routing ability of the device. In this case, it will be able to do it."
2. Failure of one single device does not affect the network:
"When the mesh topology is resistant to problems, it is exceptional. All the notes after the network translate and receive the information within it. With sufficient redundancy, the structure provides its users that they can keep it in running condition even if some malfunction occurs. If one of the nodes malfunctions, then the network has the strength to use other nodes and complete the mesh."
"In a mesh topology, there are multiple paths available for data transmission. Creating a successful set of ways to operate this topology requires each node to be connected to all the other ones for completion. as a result, the overall data transmission is more consistent. Moreover, multiple node failures do not affect the pathway and can still send a message."
4. New devices addition does not affect the data transmission:
"Mesh topology structure gives permission to the users to add new widgets for the connection of new devices without disrupting the messages. These are the messages which occur at that time. Since every node is connected, a breakdown in one of the equipment would not disrupt the information flow."
"Since each node works like an individual router, in Mesh topology, it does not require an additional router that allows one to change the size of the network comfortably. Hence, temporarily one user can easily add a new connection to any room in a corporate at the current speed-up operation."
Topology addition within the mesh is easy and goes about without any problem. One user needs to connect the nodes to the gateways to pass the messages to the remaining network for it to work. It allows the technology to become self-optimized.
"Unless there is a global disaster, in the modern structure of mesh topology in the world, it is almost impossible to take it down where all the devices we use around the globe get wiped out."
"There is no need of is centralized control within the mist apology to incorporate for sending the data. Hence, if desired, one setup an individual-based secure method of communication that lets them have the option to be anonymous. They don't need to run a firewall or other software solutions to maintain their privacy."
"Due to the partial shortfall option of mesh topology, it has an immense flexibility option in it. Therefore, for each node in this topology, one user is not forced to complete a set of connections, but the network can be built with a partial wave to take advantage of the enhanced communication."
"A tremendous volume of data can be handled with mesh topology, which is compared to traditional systems since it is possible to connect multiple devices simultaneously to transmit data simultaneously."
"For better understand the mesh topology, we should know the disadvantages or limitations of it:"
"The implementing cost in this topology is very high compared to others. This is due to the requirement of various parts of very extensive equipment. To operate correctly, we need to have all the hardware, Internet bandwidth, cabling, etc., connected properly."
"When it gets operational, then the addition of a new node is very simple, but the initial process is very complex and time-consuming."
"Due to a large number of networks can be handled by miss topology, it is a chance of setting redundant connections."
"Every node has more than one responsibility, and each one must act as a router. Hence the system is very complex."
"What a handling data transfer in a timely manner, low power mesh topology does not have the processing capacity for it. Hence there are plenty of latency issues."
"To understand the advantages and disadvantages, first we have to know about the what is Ring Topology? So, let's begin with introduction."
"To create a circular network model, each host machine connects to the other two devices in a ring topology. When one host tries to send a message or to communicate with a non-adjacent host, the data moves through all the intermediate hosts to reach the desired host."
"Only one extra cable may be needed to connect and wait for one more host by the administrator in the existing node structure. The whole ring topology losses when any of the hosts fail to connect. Thus every connection in the ring topology is a point of failure. Due to that reason, one more backup ring must be required."
"In this context, we will learn the advantages and disadvantages of ring topology along with its features of it."
"As each node in the network behaves like a repeater, long-distance communication is incredibly reliable. So the strength of the signal does not lose."
"When the network completes its communication, then the available built-in acknowledgment device in the ring topology is released."
"Since only one device has a network charge, and only two devices are allowed to communicate simultaneously, the use of tokens prohibits the chance of collisions or cross-communication in it."
"For enhancement of the fidelity of communication links, the ring topology is used in the network system. If one link breaks, then the other is prepared for communication."
"We can achieve a ring topology by executing the network with less effort. The devices can be arranged one after the other without a specific number. There are no limitations to the number of devices that we can place. Whenever we add new devices, we need to move the adjoining device."
Another classic feature of a ring network topology is high-speed data transfer. Here is a ring topology; the transmission of data that occurs between each workstation is quite fast. The interruption in the condition of the heavy load will not impact the performance.
"The construction of ring topology makes the adaptability of devices straightforward. The users will add a workstation, and it will not create any performance delay or problems in the network."
"The ring topology requires hardiness. Besides, it can still be quite reliable for use, mainly by using a set of multiple rings. The bidirectional characteristics of the ring topology guarantee very few failures. The data moves in two directions in a ring topology; for that reason, for the same node, various paths are used."
"The ring topology One Direction data flow ensures a few chances of data collisions. Therefore, the data transfer process in a ring topology is more fluid."
"The need of network servers in a ring topology is not needed because all the workstations are connected circularly in it. Therefore, in a ring topology, unique connectivity is maintained in each workstation. The use of special cables is the only element that is necessary for the ring topology to connect each device understructure."
The error and troubleshooting in a ring topology are relatively straightforward rather than one-directional.
"In case of any type of failure, ring topology, all of the workstations present in it after the malfunctioning computer will quit working. Hence the user can spend less time classifying the place of network failure."
"For establishing the network originally, a ring topology architecture requires expensive hardware components. We cannot link the workstation without the proper network cards And cables which makes the installation process pretty high. Hence it is desirable for users with a fixed budget to try some other options."
"A high-speed data transfer rate is maintained in ring topologies, but it is more leisurely than a star topology. The data passes through every workstation at the time of transferring from one device to another, which causes a lag in the time while the data reaches its destination. Therefore the whole network activity rate is slowed."
"The data in the ring topology system passes through each workstation attached. Every workstation connected can access the information up another station wait, we create a few privacy issues; why consider the unauthorized individuals who can easily interrupt users' sensitive information."
"Most ring topology network users take the one-directional path, which means that each device is interdependent. Suppose any of the workstations breaks down, then all of the networks will be destroyed."
"When a new node is attached or disconnected from the existing ring topology, it causes disturbances in the network activity. Every workstation on a ring topology is interlinked, which means that users need to bear the trouble of breaks or breakdowns during network changes."
"The entire network in a ring topology depends heavily on a single cable. Several network nodes are placed circularly on this cable. By accident, if the connector experiences any failure, the signals will face a blockage and stop traveling."
"Ring topology is minimal when it comes to bandwidth. If there are multiple devices connected, that could create bandwidth deficiencies."
"As a result, the users may experience communication impediments, which is why it is advisable to ensure that a few nodes are connected in a ring topology."
"In this context, we have learned all about Ring Topology with its advantages and disadvantages."
"To understand the advantages and disadvantages, first we have to know about the what is Star Topology? So, let's begin with introduction."
"The star topology is a standard and popular network setup. it is also known as a star network in terms. This topology is a network topology in which each piece of the network each attached to a central node. This central node is called a switch or a hub. In this network configuration, every node connects to a central network device like a switch, hub, or computer."
"In this configuration, the central network device behaves like a server, and the peripheral devices behave like clients. We can say in this configuration; a central hub acts like a channel to transmit messages. An RJ-45 or a coaxial network cable is used in the setup of a star topology network, which depends on the type of network card installed in each computer. The star network is a very popular computer network topology in the industry."
The attachment for these network pieces to the central component is presented visually to show like a star. That's why it is also known as a star network.
The star topologies can be either passive or active networks depending on the following points:
Whether the data transit in the network is controlled activity.
Whether the electrical power sources are required by the network.
Whether the central node performs data regeneration or amplification or any type of such kind of process.
"Star topology can also be implemented with cable structures, Ethernet, wireless routers are other components. In many cases, the server is the central hub for the systems, and the additional nodes are the clients."
There are many advantages of using star topology which are described below:
"Without affecting the rest of the network, the new nodes can be added easily to the star topology. In that manner, we can easily remove the components in it. So it is convenient to add more computers to the network. It also becomes easier to replace a damaged unit to maintain our productivity levels."
"The network is monitored with the help of a centralized management system using the hub, central computer, or switch."
"When a device or a cable fails, then the other devices which are connected to it will Work. Hence the rest of the network is not affected by the failure of one node or link."
"Within the star topology, when each device is connected to the central core with the help of cables, then the chances of collision of data are relatively lower. From that, it means the system's performance level is higher than expected compared to other network designs."
"Within the star topology, fault detection is easily manageable. It is because the link is often easily identified. On the other hand, in the star topology, troubleshooting and detecting failure is very easy."
"A start apology system is very useful for networks that are practical of any size. Within this network, the signal reflection is at zero risk. With the help of point-based communication connections and unicast communication, it creates a secure way to transmit data packets."
"When a NIC failure is a cut cable experienced in a star topology, it will only affect one node."
"By disabling the central core, we can simultaneously take down all of the devices. Since the central device is not available easily for everyone, it is a secure and safe network for businesses of any size that can use it to support their needs."
8. Multiple stars can be created to extend the network's reach:
"With the help of star topology, we can easily extend the length of the network right and progress on our from multiple stars in the middle with their central core as a server. Even if to support all the activities to be functional for this approach, there must be enough power in this network."
"Like many advantages of a star topology, there are also many disadvantages. The disadvantages of star topology are given below;"
"Within the star topology implementation of a router or switch, it's very costly, especially when using a router or a switch as the central network device."
"Within the star topology, when a hub malfunctions, then everything goes down because no devices can work without a hub. The main negative point in this whole network is when the central device goes down or fails, the whole system goes down."
"Within the star topology, regular maintenance and more resources are required by the hub because it is the central system of the star."
"Within the star topology, more potential damage exposure is created by the cables are wires used in it."
"It needs to go behind under floors, walls, and through other obstacles To reach the intended peripherals or workstations. Also, if the LAN needs installation work on the exterior building, it becomes susceptible to changing wildlife impacts or weather conditions."
"Then a wired star topology system works better instead of a wireless one. A wireless LAN (WLAN) mobs much slower, so the risk of a bottleneck rises."
"Although wireless star topology systems are available today, We are the most dependent on wired connections.So that it means the fixed length of the cable restricts the movement of the individual employees. Dramatically over time, this type of issue can reduce the level of productivity because one gets bound to sit at a particular distance from the central hub of the network system."
"The star topology system works well for Local Area Networks (LAN) when multiple connection points are necessary for a network. And as discussed earlier, the central hub might be expensive to install, but the data packet movement is typically faster because it is self-contained."
"To understand the advantages and disadvantages, first we have to know about the what is Tree Topology? So, let's begin with introduction."
"Bus-star topology is also known as tree topology. In tree topology, it incorporates the elements of both a bus topology as well as a star topology. Tree topology is not a commonly used network, but when a combined hierarchical or scalability setup is required between two networks, this topology comes into work. Since it appears like a tree, the structure of a tree topology is quite different from others."
"The central node of this topology acts as a strength for the network used, and it has some nodes extending outwards, just like branches of a tree. In tree topology, Only the root is seen in between any two nodes on the network. The connection pattern looks like a tree whose branches spread from only one route."
"Tree topology is a hybrid of bus topology and star topology. In a bus topology, all the other nodes are connected by a central node known as the bus."
"Each and every node in a star topology is connected through hubs. For that reason, tree topology is an expansion of these two topologies, which is easily called an expanded star topology."
"In this topology, only one connection exists Between any two connected nodes. There is a mutual relationship exists between the two nodes. So a parent and child hierarchy is created in a tree topology. In this topology, for forming a hierarchical structure, all the nodes of this network are connected through a central node. Hence it is also known as hierarchical topology."
It is one of the simplest approaches among all the topologies. Tree topologies are flexible and reliable. One has to connect extra cables and a hub for the expansion of this network.
"Tree topology networks can also be connected in large areas. One can click as many servers as they go through the network. When any data is transmitted through your computer, it will get broadcasted in the hub, and then the message will be conveyed by the hub to the designated computer."
"Error detection in a tree topology becomes more accessible. In this tree topology, the central node connects all the nodes present in it. The error in this node can be easily detected by the hub since all the information transmitted through the node passes through the hub. By replacing the faulty node in this network, we can easily replace the node which has a mistake in it."
"If a single node gets defective in the tree topology, it will not affect the other nodes. The tree topology network is created based on the main backbone cable. Hence, the failure of 1 node would not affect the other nodes, and the other nodes will regularly continue to function. The performance of the network would not be affected by the removal of any node in it."
"The expansion of a tree topology is a straightforward method. Though this topology has no space, it can be expanded. In this topology, without any issue, many secondary nodes can be attached to it since this topology follows a hierarchy pattern. As long as enough cables and hubs are present, the expansion won't be a problem."
"A tree topology is the best considerable option at the time of the addition of new devices. Due to its hybrid approach, various manufacturers support this type of network. For maintenance and other work, he allowed the manufacturers to access the devices connected to the network easily."
"Any cables are not required at the time of installation of a tree topology. The single cable in this type of topology acts like the backbone of the network, and it runs joint for all the network segments. every tree network is presented with a point to point wiring. This type of point-to-point wiring in this network ensures high bandwidth and low latency."
"Due to its difficulty during the installation process, the uses of tree topology are very limited. Both bus and star topology functions are included in the tree topology. Hence the cabling requirement of a tree topology is massive. For that reason, the installation process of this topology becomes difficult to handle and expensive."
"Extremely weak security is present in a tree topology. All the computers in this topology are interconnected with each other. As a result, any computer within this network can access the data that can pass through the network. So, if a hacker tries to take over a single workstation, they can easily and quickly access all the data; hence, the whole network is compromised."
"The backbone cable of the tree topology is the main cable on which the entire network depends. If the backbone cable gets defective and fails, then the whole network will collapse. The point where the failure occurs also decides the level of loss. If the damage is restricted before a specific branch, all the segments related to that branch will face problems while functioning. On the other hand, the components which are not associated with it will continue to work usually."
"The cable length of a tree topology is also an essential factor. While creating the point-to-point connection in tree topology, the cable length is limited to a certain point by default. This limitation later causes trouble since it makes it challenging to get wired. Regardless of this, there will be high wiring requirements if the network needs expansion, which will increase the total cost."
"Maintenance and configuration of tree topology become difficult due to its large size. A lot of time is taken up for managing point-to-point connections, individual star networks, and the identification of errors. This is amongst one of the major reasons why large organizations less prefer tree topology."
"Zigbee is one of the wireless personal area network (WPAN) specifications. It is designed to meet low-power and low data rate applications and is developed under IEEE 802.15.4 standard by The Zigbee Alliance. Typically, Zigbee is used in establishing a smart home for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other to enable automation."
"Hence, it is also called the smart home protocol. For example, the light system can be linked to the security cameras, and the coffee maker can be linked to the alarm system so that the coffee is ready for you when you wake up."
"If we want a network for short-range communication for streaming audio, we opt for Bluetooth. For streaming videos and larger files, we use Wi-Fi. But, we need a network using which we can connect a large number of battery-powered devices. We can't go for Wi-Fi because of its high energy requirements, and we can't choose Bluetooth even though it consumes less power, as only a small number of devices can be connected using Bluetooth."
"We need a network that can connect many battery-powered devices, and the main aspect here is low energy/ power consumption. This is the whole purpose of developing Zigbee Technology. Zigbee revolves around control and sensor networks. Hence, it is one of the most common standards and applications for the Internet of Things (IoT)."
"Zigbee networks use Mesh Topology, which gives a separate link for every device pair in the Network. Even if one link fails, the Network can utilize another alternate path/ link for communication. Hence, it is reliable."
"Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, on the other hand, use Star topology, where each node/ device is connected to a central node that can be a hub, router, or switch. If the link to a device fails, the device gets disconnected from the Network. If the central node fails, the whole Network will be down."
The catch with these networks is that they offer a low data rate.
"The applications of Zigbee are designed in a way that the required data rate is low. For example, one of the biggest companies that use Zigbee technology is Amazon's smart home services."
"These networks are also secured with 128-bit AES symmetric encryption keys. A single Zigbee network can support up to 65,000 nodes. Zigbee also uses the same frequency band as the Wifi-2.4GHz Electromagnetic spectrum. The recent developments of Amazon and Google, like Alexa and Google Home, also support Zigbee connections."
"In a Zigbee network, there will be three types of devices:"
The End device is a battery-powered device that we use. These devices communicate with the Zigbee Coordinator.
A Zigbee router isn't the same as a Wi-Fi router. It can send information to the Coordinator and route data from Zigbee end devices to the Coordinator.
"The Zigbee router is a mains-powered device, which means it is directly connected to the house's main power. So, there is no concern about its battery life."
"The Coordinator is also a mains-powered device, and every Zigbee network will have only one Coordinator."
It is responsible for starting and maintaining the Network and selecting the network security mode.
It receives the information from the end devices and bridges the information to the home network for us to access from our phones or tablets.
There can be any Zigbee routers in a network but only one Coordinator.
The Zigbee Coordinator can route traffic and is responsible for establishing the Network in the first place.
"Using the Zigbee routers, We can connect the end devices that are otherwise out of range."
It helps with the mesh capabilities of the Network by providing alternate links if any one link fails during communication.
"Zigbee is the best Network for battery-powered devices as it allows them to turn off/ sleep when they aren't used. When needed, the Network quickly wakes them up, thus saving power."
"Though battery-powered, Zigbee devices can have a good life span due to the Network's power-saving capabilities."
"Zigbee is an open standard. There are a large variety of devices available from different manufacturers. Hence, Zigbee devices are available at low costs."
Extending a Wi-Fi network is more time-consuming and costly than extending a Zigbee network.
"When the Coordinator is replaced, all the Zigbee devices aren't automatically connected to the new Coordinator. Every connection has to be manually established again."
The open standard of Zigbee brought compatibility issues. Not every Zigbee device is compatible with every Zigbee network. Even the devices from the same manufacturer as the other devices in a network might need to be compatible with the Network.
"Zigbee 3.0 forces the manufacturers to follow a specific standard to be certified, but it still needs to be implemented"
"Due to its low bandwidth, Zigbee doesn't support audio and Video applications like Doorbells and CCTV cameras."
"Isn't the word Zigbee weird for technology? Here is the analogy behind the name. The word Zigbee refers to the waggle dance of honey bees. When a bee finds a source for nectar or pollen, it returns to the comb and dances to let its nest mates know the source's location, distance, and direction. The bee in the name specifies it all. The Zigbee Alliance found the name suitable, intrigued by the silent yet powerful communication through dance."
The network layer is the third layer from the bottom of the OSI model. This layer transfers variable-length data sequences while maintaining the quality of service from source to destination and from one network to another.
"This layer handles many links, and data are expressed in the form of packets. The essential function it performs is routing which means packets are transmitted from one network to another to reach the destination with the help of the routers. Routing is the process that chooses the fast and reliable shortest path for traveling data packets from one place to another, which means this layer ensures that the data packets are transmitted over the best possible route."
"Internetworking: It is the process of connecting different networks by using intermediate devices such as switches, routers, gateways, and more to forward the data packets."
Host-to-Host delivery of data: It is also known as source-to-destination data delivery or machine-to-machine data delivery. The network layer has the responsibility of transmitting packets of data from one host to another. It makes sure that the data packets reach the correct destination system.
"Logical Addressing: The data packets sent by the sender contain both source and destination IP addresses in the header so that the data packets can reach their desired destination without any problem. An IP address is utilized to recognize the device in the network. An IP address is a mixture of two things: Host ID and Network ID. There are many networks, hosts, machines, or servers, so adding an IP address to the header identifies the correct host the data packet should reach."
"Routing: It is the process of choosing the best path for securely transmitting data packets from the source host to the destination host. There are many routers between the sender and receiver, and routing is done with the help of these routers. Packets of data are routed from one router to another router and then to another router based on the information available in the header and forwarding table; thus, the data packets reach the destination device. There are various routing algorithms which are protocols that are followed to transmit data packets using the routing process."
"Fragmentation: Each node has a size capacity to receive data. The maximum capacity that a node can achieve is called the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). Different nodes may have different capacities. If the data size exceeds the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), then the data packet is broken into fragments, and the process is called fragmentation. After that, all the fragments are sent to the destination host. Fragmentation is done in the network layer by routers."
"Packetizing: It handles the data received from the upper layer and converts it into packets to reach the destination. If the packet is segmented at the source, then the network layer must ensure that each fragment reaches the destination properly and correctly."
"Congestion Control: If the load on the network exceeds the capacity of the network leads to congestion which can also be handled in the network layer. Congestion control is a technique used to control congestion which can be handled using the Leaky Bucket and Token Bucket algorithms. As per Leaky Bucket Algorithm, whatever the speed of the data packet from the source host, the packets are thrown into the bucket, which leaks the data at a constant rate, i.e., high traffic is converted into constant traffic with the help of the Leaky Bucket. On the other hand, according to the token bucket algorithm, tokens are thrown into a bucket at regular intervals, and if the bucket reaches its maximum capacity, it stops taking tokens. It holds all the tokens until the capacity is reached, queues up the tokens, and sends them to the destination."
"However, there are many protocols that are used by the network layer to perform its task properly, and we will discuss some of the protocols below:"
"IGMP: It is an abbreviation for Internet Group Management Protocol. It is used to set up multicasting on a network. In other words, we can say that it allows devices to join a multicasting group so that all the devices can receive the same data. It can be utilized for many networking applications, such as online gaming and video streaming."
"ICMP: It is an abbreviation for Internet Control Message Protocol. It sends a message to the sender if something unexpected happens during data processing. Hosts, routers, and other network devices use this protocol to communicate about errors and then update hosts, routers, and other network devices."
"ARP: It is an abbreviation for Address Resolution Protocol. Its job is to resolve the IP address to the MAC address. It is important to know the IP address and MAC address of the devices for the purpose of communication. If you know the IP address of the device but do not know the MAC address, then ARP helps to find the MAC address for proper communication."
"DHCP: It is an abbreviation for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Making the device accessible to the internet requires the device to be allotted an IP address which can be done manually or automatically with the help of a network administrator. network administrator. If there are too many devices, then the network administrator configures a special host called a DHCP server that automatically assigns IP addresses to all the hosts in the network so that they can communicate with each other."
OSPF: It is an abbreviation for Open Shortest Path First. It is called an (IGRP) Interior Gateway Routing Protocol. OSPF observes the situation of all network connections and automatically determines the shortest path for routing data packets. It operates within a single AS (Autonomous System). It utilizes the link state routing or the shortest path first algorithm.
"BGP: It is an abbreviation for Border Gateway Protocol. It is an external gateway routing protocol, and the job of this protocol is to route the data over the internet to the destination in a fast and efficient manner. Autonomous systems are linked to each other with the help of BGP."
This article gave you information about the network layer in the OSI model. This layer is responsible for sending data packets from one host to another.
"The network layer in the OSI model performs many functions, such as internetworking, host-to-host delivery of data, logical addressing, routing, fragmentation, packetizing, and congestion control."
The major role of the network layer is to convert the data received from the upper layer into data packets and transfer them using the best route to the destination system without any data loss.
"You have studied protocols of network layer like Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)."
"The OSI model is the abbreviation for Open Systems Interconnection Model. It defines the transmission of data from one system to another in a computer network. For example, in the most elemental form, two systems are joined to each other using Local Area Network (LAN) cables and share data with the help of a Network Interface Card (NIC) that allows communication over a network, but if one system is based on Microsoft Windows, and the other is based on macOS, so how would these computers communicate with each other. To successfully communicate between systems of distinct architectures, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) presented the 7-layered OSI model in 1984."
The individual layer of the OSI model is a package of protocols. This article will comprehend the physical layer of the OSI model.
The physical layer is the first and lowest layer from the bottom of the 7-layered OSI model and delivers security to hardware. This layer is in charge of data transmission over the physical medium. It is the most complex layer in the OSI model.
"The physical layer converts the data frame received from the data link layer into bits, i.e., in terms of ones and zeros. It maintains the data quality by implementing the required protocols on different network modes and maintaining the bit rate through data transfer using a wired or wireless medium."
The physical layer has several attributes that are implemented in the OSI model:
1. Signals: The data is first converted to a signal for efficient data transmission. There are two kinds of signals:
"Analog Signals: These signals are continuous waveforms in nature and are represented by continuous electromagnetic waves for the transmission of data.

Digital Signals: These signals are discrete in nature and represent network pulses and digital data from the upper layers."
Digital Signals: These signals are discrete in nature and represent network pulses and digital data from the upper layers.
2. Transmission media: Data is carried from source to destination with the help of transmission media. There are two sorts of transmission media:
"Wired Media: The connection is established with the help of cables. For example, fiber optic cables, coaxial cables, and twisted pair cables."
"Wireless Media: The connection is established using a wireless communication network. For example, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc."
3. Data Flow: It describes the rate of data flow and the transmission time frame. The factors affecting the data flow are as follows:
Bandwidth: The rate of transmission of data in the channel.
4. Transmission mode: It describes the direction of the data flow. Data can be transmitted in three sorts of transmission modes as follows:
"Simplex mode: This mode of communication is a one-way communication where a device can only send data. Examples are a mouse, keyboard, etc."
"Half-duplex mode: This mode of communication supports one-way communication, i.e., either data can be transmitted or received. An example is a walkie-talkie."
"Full-duplex mode: This mode of communication supports two-way communication, i.e., the device can send and receive data at the same time. An example is cellular communication."
5. Noise in transmission: Transmitted data can get corrupted or damaged during data transmission due to many reasons. Some of the reasons are mentioned below:
Attenuation: It is a gradual deterioration of the network signal on the communication channel.
"Dispersion: In the case of Dispersion, the data is dispersed and overlapped during transmission, which leads to the loss of the original data."
Data Delay: The transmitted data reaches the destination system outside the specified frame time.
It transfers data bit by bit or symbol by symbol.
"It performs bit synchronization, which means that only one bit needs to be transferred from one system to another at a time. There should be no overlapping of bits during transmission. Bit synchronization can be achieved by providing a clock."
"Bit rate control defines how many bits per second can be transmitted, i.e., the number of bits sent per second."
"The physical layer is responsible for knowing the arrangements made between devices in networks called physical topologies, such as mesh, ring, bus, and star."
"The transmission mode in which data is transmitted, and there are three modes of transmitting data: full-duplex, half-duplex, and simplex."
"It is responsible for point-to-multipoint, point-to-point, or multipoint line configurations."
It is responsible for flow control and start-stop signaling in asynchronous serial communication.
"Signal processing of physical signals such as training sequence, pulse shaping, equalization filtering, and others."
"It provides a standardized interface for physical transmission media, including electrical specifications for transmission line signal levels, mechanical specifications for electrical cables and connectors, radio interfaces, and wireless IR communication links, IR specifications."
"The physical layer is responsible for modulation, which means the conversion of information into radio waves by adding the data to an optical nerve signal or electrical signal."
"This layer is concerned with auto-negotiation. Signals are mainly of two sorts, digital signals & analog signals. The physical layer decides which signal will be used to transfer the data from one point to another."
It also avoids collisions between data flowing in the network due to the irretrievability of data packets.
It is responsible for the translation of data received from the data link layer for further transmission.
"Physical topology refers to the specification or structure of the connections of the network between the devices where the transmission will happen. There are four types of topologies, which are as follows:"
"Star topology is a sort of network topology in which each node or device in the network is individually joined to a central node, which can be a switch or a hub. This topology looks like a star, due to which this topology is called star topology."
"Hub does not provide route data, but it transmits data to other devices connected to it. The advantage of this topology is that if one cable fails, the device connected to that cable is affected, and not the others."
"Bus topology comprises a single communication line or cable that is connected to each node. The backbone of this network is the central cable, and each node can communicate with other devices through the central cable."
"The signal goes from the ground terminator to the other terminator of the wire. The terminator stops the signal once it reaches the end of the wire to avoid signal bounce. Each computer communicates independently with other computers in what is called a peer-to-peer network. Each computer has a unique address, so if a message is to be sent to a specific computer, the device can communicate directly with that computer."
The advantage of bus topology is that collapse in one device will not affect other devices. The bus topology is not expensive to build because it uses a single wire and works well for small networks.
"In a ring topology, the devices are connected in the form of a ring so that each device has two neighbors for communication. Data moves around the ring in one direction."
"As you can see below, all four devices are connected to each other in the form of a ring. Each device has two neighbors. Node 2 and Node 4 are neighbors of Node 1; similarly, Node 1 and Node 3 are neighbors of Node 2, and so on."
"The advantage of ring topology is that if you want to add another device to the ring, you will need an additional cable to do so. Similarly, you can remove a device and join the wires."
"In a mesh topology, each system is directly joined to every other system. The advantage of mesh topology is that there will be no traffic issues as each device has a dedicated communication line. If one system is not functioning, it will not affect other devices. It provides more security or privacy."
The drawback of mesh topology is that it is expensive and more complex than other topologies.
"Without proper data conversion at the physical level, the network cannot function."
The physical layer is responsible for maintaining communication between the hardware and the network mode.
It handles the data flow rate of the data to be transmitted along with the timeframe of the transmitted data.
You studied the physical layer in OSI model in this article. The physical layer provides the hardware needed to transmit and receive bits over a network link.
"You have studied the attributes of the physical layer, such as types of signals used for data transmission, wired and wireless media of transmission, rate of data flow, and noise in transmission."
You have read about the various functions and responsibilities of the physical layer.
"You have studied physical topologies such as star topology, bus topology, ring topology, and mesh topology."
"Finally, you have gained knowledge about the importance of the physical layer in the OSI model."
"The Data Link Layer is the 2nd layer from the bottom to the top of the OSI model. Its job is to provide node-to-node delivery of data. The primary role of the data link layer is to check whether the data transmitted from one point to another node point on the physical layer is error-free or not. If any error occurs during data transmission, the data link layer will discard that data and resend the data. This layer is responsible for reliable and efficient communication between devices."
"The data packet travels from the network layer to the data link layer. These data packets are further divided into frames, and the frame size is chosen based on the NIC (Network Interface Card) used in the system."
"This layer sets a logical layer between two points. It helps to manage the traffic control of frames on the network by stopping the transmitted signal when the frame buffer is full. For the transmission of information, the data link layer uses devices such as switches, bridges, etc."
"The data link layer is classified into two sub-layers, which are given below:"
Logical Link Control (LLC) or Data Link Control (DLC) Sublayer: LLC or DLC is the topmost layer of the data link layer. It deals with the communication between the lower layers and upper layers. This sublayer runs above the data link layer and provides flow control and error information. It is responsible for assigning the frame sequence number. It specifies the mechanism that can be used to address stations on a transmission medium and to control the data exchanged between the sender and the receiver.
"Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer: The bottom sublayer of the Data Link Layer is the Media Access Control. It is also known as Medium Access Control. It provides multiplexing and flow control for the transmission media. The main responsibility of this sublayer is to encapsulate the frame, check for transmission errors, and then allow the frame to be forwarded to the upper layer. It determines who is permitted to access the media at any given time."
"Hop to Hop or Node to Node delivery of data: The responsibility of the Data Link Layer (DLL) is to provide hop-to-hop delivery of data. The data link layer determines the node to which the data should be sent first, then the following node the data should be sent to, and so on, till the information arrives at the destination system."
"Framing: It is a process of encapsulating data packets obtained from the network layer into frames for transmission. Each frame consists of a header, a payload field, and a trailer. The header contains the frame start bits, the address of both the source and destination, the type of data, and quality control bits. The payload field contains the data packet. The trailer contains error detection bits, error correction bits, and frame stop bits."
"Physical addressing: The Data Link Layer attaches the physical addresses of the receiver and sender to the header of each frame. To send information from source to destination, you must know what we are sending and where we are sending it."
"Error control: During transmission, the frame can get corrupted by any cause. The error can be controlled in the data link layer in three phases of error control as follows:

Error detection: The error in the data frame is detected with the help of error detection bits present in the frame trailer.
Acknowledgment: After receiving the data frame, the receiver responds to inform the sender about the successful delivery of the data frame. This acknowledgment can be positive or negative. If the data frame is received successfully, it sends positive feedback to the sender; otherwise, it sends negative feedback to the sender.
Retransmission: If the receiver successfully receives the data frame, the sender sends the next set of data frames, but if the data frame does not reach the receiver successfully, the sender must resend the data frames."
Error detection: The error in the data frame is detected with the help of error detection bits present in the frame trailer.
"Acknowledgment: After receiving the data frame, the receiver responds to inform the sender about the successful delivery of the data frame. This acknowledgment can be positive or negative. If the data frame is received successfully, it sends positive feedback to the sender; otherwise, it sends negative feedback to the sender."
"Retransmission: If the receiver successfully receives the data frame, the sender sends the next set of data frames, but if the data frame does not reach the receiver successfully, the sender must resend the data frames."
"Flow Control: The receiver should be able to receive the data frame at the same speed at which the sender is sending the data frame, i.e., both the sender and the receiver should work at the same speed. If the sender sends frames with high speed and the receiver receives frames with low speed, the sender will be overloaded, resulting in loss of data."
Data loss can be handled with the help of two mechanisms:
"Stop and wait: The sender should wait until the acknowledgment is received from the receiver for frame-1. The sender will wait for the response of the receiver, and then it will send the next data frame."
"Sliding Window: Here, instead of sending acknowledgment after each frame, the sender sends acknowledgment after some set of frames."
Synchronous Data Link Protocol (SDLC): It is the first bit-oriented protocol and is widely used. It is a subset of the High-Level Data Link Protocol. IBM developed this protocol in 1975. It manages synchronous serially transmitted bits over a data link layer.
High-Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC): It is a bit-oriented protocol for conveying data on point-to-multipoint and point-to-point links. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed this protocol in 1979. It is based on Synchronous Data Link Protocol. It provides connectionless and connection-oriented services. It provides two transmission modes: Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM) and Normal Feedback Mode (NRM).
Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP): It is a simple internet protocol through which the user is allowed to access the internet with the help of a computer modem. Rick Adams developed this protocol in 1984. It works with TCP/IP for communication over the router and serial port.
"Point to Point Protocol (PPP): It is a character-oriented or byte-oriented protocol. PPP is a WAN protocol that runs over an Internet link. It is used in broadband communication. It is used to transmit multiprotocol data between point-to-point devices. It provides transmission encryption, loop connection authentication, and compression of data."
Network Control Protocol (NCP): This layer was implemented by ARPANET. It allows transferring data between two devices. It is a part of the point-to-point protocol. This network layer will carry the data packets from the origin to the goal.
Link Control Protocol (LCP): This layer is also a component of the point-to-point protocol. It is mainly used for establishing and maintaining the link before sending data.
"Link Access Procedure (LAP): It is derived from the high-level data link protocol. It is used for framing and data transmission over point-to-point links. It has several Link Access Protocols, such as Multilink Procedure (MLP), Link Access Procedure for Modems (LAPM), Link Access Procedure for Half-Duplex (LAPX), and Link Access Procedure for Frame Relay (LAPF)."

"You have understood that the Data Link Layer in the OSI model has two sublayers, which are the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer and the Data Link Control (DLC) sublayer or Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer."

"Without demonstrating how SSL completes its tasks, we have only talked about the concept of SSL in the previous section. <Please add the link to the previous file of SSL and SSL Architecture> According to the diagram below, SSL defines four protocols over two layers:"
"The transport mechanism is the Record Protocol. Along with the information from the application layer, it also contains messages from three more protocols. The payload of the transport layer, which is often TCP, is a message from the Record Protocol. The Record Protocol's security parameters are provided via the Handshake Protocol. It creates a cypher set, offers keys, and specifies security parameters. Additionally, if necessary, it authenticates both the client and the server. The ChangeCipherSpec Protocol is used to announce when cryptographic secrets are ready. Anomalies are reported via the Alert Protocol. In this part, we'll briefly go through all four protocols."
"The Handshake Protocol employs messages to exchange data for constructing the cryptographic secrets as well as to negotiate the cypher suite, and authenticate the server to the client and the client to the server as necessary. The four phases of the handshake are depicted in the following figure."
"The client and server disclose their security capabilities in Phase I and pick the ones that work best for them both. A session ID is created during this stage, and the cypher suite is decided upon. The parties select a specific compression technique. In order to create a master secret, as we have seen before, two random integers are finally chosen, one by the client and one by the server. Following Phase I, both the client and the server are aware of the SSL version, the cryptographic techniques, the compression technique, and the two random integers used to generate the key."
"Authentication for the server takes place in Phase II, if necessary. In addition to requesting certificates from the client, the server has the option of sending its certificate and public key. When Phase II is complete, the client and server have been authenticated, and if necessary, the client has access to the server's public key."
"Phase III is used to verify the client's identity. After Phase III, the client and server can verify each other and share the pre-master secret."
"In Phase IV, the client and server exchange messages to finalize the Handshake Protocol and alter the cypher parameters."
"As we've seen, the Handshake Protocol allows for the gradual formation of cryptographic secrets as well as the negotiation of the cypher suite. When are these parameters or secrets available for usage by the two parties, then? SSL requires that these parameters or secrets cannot be used by the parties until they have exchanged or received a specific message, the ChangeCipherSpec message, which is done so during the Handshake Protocol and is specified in the ChangeCipherSpec Protocol. The reason is that the problem goes beyond simple message sending and receiving. Two states, not one, are required for the sender and the receiver. The parameters and secrets are tracked by one state, the pending state. The active state, which is the other state, contains the parameters and secrets that the Record Protocol uses to sign, validate, or encrypt and decode messages. Additionally, read (inbound) and write (outbound) data are stored in each state separately."
SSL reports problems and strange conditions using the Alert Protocol. It just makes use of one message to describe the issue and its severity (warning or fatal).
"Messages from the top layer are transmitted through the Record Protocol (Handshake Protocol, ChangeCipherSpec Protocol, Alert Protocol, or application layer). The message is split into pieces and, if desired, compressed; the compressed message is then added to by adding a MAC with the agreed-upon hashing algorithm. Utilizing the agreed-upon encryption procedure, the compressed fragment and MAC are both encrypted. The encrypted communication is then supplemented with the SSL header. This process at the sender is shown in the given Figure. The recipient reverses the process."
"The presentation layer is the 6th layer from the bottom in the OSI model. This layer presents the incoming data from the application layer of the sender machine to the receiver machine. It converts one format of data to another format of data if both sender and receiver understand different formats; hence this layer is also called the translation layer. It deals with the semantics and syntax of the data, so this layer is also called the syntax layer. It uses operations such as data compression, data encryption & decryption, data conversion, etc."
"Translation:Data is sent from sender to receiver, but what if the sender device and receiver device understand different formats of code? For example, suppose one device understands ASCII code and another device understands EBCDIC code. In that case, the data must be translated into a code that the recipient understands to determine what data has been sent. The presentation layer is responsible for translating ASCII codes to EBCDIC or vice versa. With the help of the presentation layer, the receiver understands the data effectively and uses it efficiently."
"Encryption and Decryption: Whatever data is being transmitted between the sender and the receiver, that data must be secure because an intruder can hack the data passing between the sender and the receiver. Hackers can modify the data and send the modified data to the receiver to create false communication. The presentation layer is responsible for encrypting and decrypting data to avoid data leakage and data modification.
The plaintext data at the source is encrypted into ciphertext (unreadable format), then it is sent to the receiver, where the ciphertext is decrypted into plaintext. Now, if the hacker tries to hack the data, the hacker receives an encrypted, unreadable form, and if the hacker tries to send modified data, the receiver can detect the modification during decryption; thereby, the data remains safe."
"Compression and Decompression: If the file size is large, it becomes difficult to transmit the large file over the network. File size can be decreased by compressing the file for easy transmission of data. Compression is the method of diminishing the size of a file to transmit data easily in less time. When the compressed data reaches the receiver, the data is reconstructed back to the original size, and this process is called decompression."
The presentation layer in the OSI model is classified into two sublayers:
"Common Application Service Element (CASE): This sublayer offers services to layer-7, i.e., the application layer, and requests services from layer-5, i.e., the session layer. It supports various application services, such as Reliable Transfer Service Element (RTSE), Remote Operation Service Element (ROSE), Association Control Service Element (ACSE), and Commitment Concurrency and Recovery (CCR)."
"Specific Application Service Element (SASE): This sublayer offers application-specific protocols, such as Message Oriented Text Interchange Standard (MOTIS), Remote Database Access (RDA), File Transfer Access and Manager (FTAM), Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP), Virtual Terminal (VT), Distributed Transaction Processing (DTP), Job Transfer and Manipulation (JTM), and others."
"Independent Computing Architecture (ICA): It is a presentation layer protocol in the OSI model, which was formed by Citrix Systems. It is used for transferring data from server to client. It is a very thin protocol as it does not require much overhead in order to transmit data from the server over to the client. It is well-optimized for the WAN."
"Network Data Representation (NDR): It is the protocol that is used to implement the presentation layer of the OSI model. It provides different kinds of data representation, such as images, video, audio, numbers, etc. It is used for Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (Microsoft RPC) and Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) / Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)."
"Apple Filing Protocol (AFP): It is a communication protocol that was specifically designed for macOS by Apple, Inc. It provides file services for Classic Mac OS and macOS. This protocol is used to share files over the network."
"NetWare Core Protocol (NCP): It is a protocol that is associated with the client-server operating system. The user can access the directory, print, message, file, clock synchronization, etc., with the help of this protocol. It supports many platforms, such as Linux, Classic Mac OS, Windows NT, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows."
Packet Assembler/Disassembler Protocol (PAD): It is a telecommunications equipment that splits a stream of data into separate packets and formats packet headers for asynchronous communication on X.25 networks. It receives packets from the network and converts them into a stream of data. The PAD provides many asynchronous terminal connectivities to a host computer.
"eXternal Data Representation (XDR): It is a computer network protocol that is used to transfer data between two systems. It was first published in 1987. XDR is used by various systems such as NDMP, Network File System, NetCDF, ZFS, Open Network Computer Remote Procedure Call, and others."
Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP): It is a protocol that offers ISO presentation services over TCP/IP based networks. This protocol explains an approach to provide stream-line support for OSI over TCP/IP based networks.
"In this article, you have studied the presentation layer in the OSI model. It is a 6th layer in the OSI model that translates one data format into another data format. The presentation layer may also be called the translation layer or syntax layer."
"You have learned about the functions of the presentation layer, such as translation, encryption & decryption, and compression & decompression."
"You have understood that there are two sublayers of the presentation layer, which are the Common Application Service Element (CASE) and the Specific Application Service Element (SASE)."
"You have gained knowledge of several protocols of the presentation layer, such as Network Data Representation (NDR), Independent Computing Architecture (ICA), NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), Packet Assembler/Disassembler Protocol (PAD), eXternal Data Representation (XDR), and Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP)."
"The session layer is Layer 5 layer from the bottom in the OSI model. The job of the session layer is to control and maintain connections between systems to share data. It establishes, maintains, and ends sessions across all channels. In case of a network error, it checks the authenticity and provides recovery options for active sessions. It manages sessions and synchronizes data flow."
"Basically, this layer regulates when computers can send data and how much data they can send. Essentially it coordinates communication between devices."
"Session Establishment: The session layer establishes connections between devices which is known as sessions. The session which is created allows users to share data, remote access, and file management. When the session is released, the transport connection is mapped. The ways in which transport connection maps are one-to-many, one-to-one, and many-to-one."
"Data Transfer: It is the very basic function of the session layer, which handles the exchange of data between systems in a full-duplex or half-duplex mode of transmission. The session layer allows only one user to transmit data in half-duplex as well as exchange data in full-duplex mode."
"Dialog Management: The session layer keeps log data on which connections are established to transmit and receive data, which is called dialog management. It is accountable for establishing, synchronizing, preserving, and ending the conversation between the sender and the receiver. It uses a token mechanism in which the user sharing the data is given a token in case of half duplex mode and, after the exchange, transfers it to another device. The token method maintains the efficiency of the connection."
"Synchronization: The session maintains proper connectivity between systems, and if any error occurs, then it provides a recovery option which is called a known state. The session layer adds synchronization bits to the message to use the known state in the event of an error. These bits can be used as checkpoints. It adds synchronization points or checkpoints to the data stream for longer communication. It ensures that the data streams are successfully received and acknowledged up to the checkpoints. In case of any failure, only the stream needs to be retransmitted after the checkpoints."
Authentication: The process of identification is known as authentication. It takes a guarantee from the user to permit them access to the data. Authentication is very important because it provides security.
Authorization: It grants privileges after authentication of the user. Authorization means providing access to the data that is authorized to the specific user.
"The session layer offers many network protocols for the safety, security, and efficiency of communication between devices."
"RTCP: It is an abbreviation for Real-time Transport Control Protocol. It is used to provide audio and video over the Internet. Basically, it periodically transmits control packets to all participants in the session. It provides feedback on QoS (Quality of Service) to all participants in the session. It is used in video conferencing, television services, etc."
"PPTP: It is the full form of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. This is the technology used to implement VPN. With the help of PPTP, data can be transmitted securely from one node to another through a tunnel."
"PAP: It is an abbreviation for Password Authentication Protocol. The point-to-point protocol uses it to authenticate the user. It takes care of whether the user is authentic or not and then grants access. It works in such a way that the user will enter the id and password, then after the authentication, the server will reply with a confirmation. It is a weak type of authentication system as it is highly vulnerable to attackers."
"ADSP: It is an abbreviation for AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol. It is a networking protocol that was introduced 38 years ago, in 1985, and was created for Apple Macintosh networks. It allows users to share printers and folders for access by other network users."
RPC: It is an abbreviation for Remote Procedure Call Protocol. It helps in communication between processes that are residing in different systems connected over a network. It helps one program to request a service from another program located on another computer on a network. The processes that are communicating do not need to comprehend the details of the network.
iSNS: It is an abbreviation for Internet Storage Name Service. It manages and configures Fibre Channel and iSCSI devices. This protocol is used by many platforms.
SDP: It is an abbreviation for Sockets Direct Protocol. It is a standard wire protocol that supports stream sockets on RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) fabrics.
"In this article, you have gained knowledge of the session layer in the OSI model. It is the fifth layer of the OSI model. The work of this layer is to open, maintain and end the session for safe and secure communication."
"You have studied the various functions of the session layer in OSI model, such as session establishment, dialog management, data transfer, synchronization, authentication, and authorization."
"You have read some of the protocols used in the session layer like Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP), Remote Procedure Call Protocol (RPC), Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP), and Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS)."
"Every computer device has two pieces of IP address: the host or client address and the network or server address. Either the IP addresses are configured manually, which is the static IP address, or by a DHCP server. The IP addresses are split into the network address and the host by the subnet mask. It depends on which part of the IP address belongs to the device and which part belongs to the network."
"Gateway or default gateway creates a connection between the local device to the other network. According to that, when a local device wants to send information to the device with an IP address on other networks, then it will first send the packets to the gateway, and after that, it forwards the data to the destination, which is located outside the local network."
"A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting the host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask is separated the IP address into the host address and network address. The broadcast address is always assigned to the ""255"" address, and a network address is always assigned to the ""0"" address. Since the subnet mask is reserved for a special purpose, it cannot be assigned to the host."
"An underlying structure is comprised of the subnet mask, IP address, and gateway or router. When a system needs additional subnetting, then the host element of the IP address to divided by subnetting, and it further divides into the subnet. The subnetting process is the main goal of the subnet mask."
A single device of an IP network is identified by a 32-bit IP address. The binary bits of that 32-bit IP address are divided into a network section and a host by the subnet mask. They are also broken into four 8-bit octets.
"Since the binary is challenging, we convert each update which is expressed in dot decimal."
"For IP address, it is converted to the characteristics dotted decimal format."
"Since all sides of networks can be accommodated on the internet, then based on how the octet in an IP address is broken down, an addressing scheme for a range of networks exists. We can calculate it upon the three high-order or leftmost weights of any described IP address. This IP address should have different classes of the network, a to e, the addresses in it."
"From the above five different classes of the network, the d class network is reserved for multicasting; on the other hand, the class network is not used on the internet. It is because the internet engineering task force (IETF) they are out for research."
"The network portion in the first octet is reflected by the class a subnet mask, and it leaves opted, three and four for the network manager for the purpose of dividing the hosts and subnets as required. 65,536 hosts are included in the class a network."
"The class b subnet mask makes sure the first two actors further network without the remaining part of the address, and the 16-bit after it is four and three for the host and subnet part. A number from 256 to 65,534 hosts for the class b network."
"On the other hand, in the class c subnet mask, there are three updates with a combination of hosts and the southerners in the last octet 4 8 bits. Lower than 254 hosts in class c, there are a smaller number of networks."
"Rather than there are natural masks or default subnet masks of class a, b &c."
Any given local network weekend determines the number and type of IP address based on its default subnet mask.
It is a technique in which a single physical network is logically partitioned into multiple smaller subnetworks or subnets.
"By adding subnets without a new number, an organization enables subnetting for the purpose of concealing the network complexity and reducing the network traffic. Subnetting is essential when a single network number is used across many segments of a local area network."
For surpassing LAN constraints to allow organizations such as maximum number of hosts
"Classless interdomain routing (CIDR) is the standard modern network prefix that is used for both IPV4 and IPV6. Network masks are the addresses of IPV4, which is represented in CIDR notation. Also, they are a specified number of bits in the prefix to the address after a (/) separator. For denote routing or network fixes, this is the format of soul standard based."
"Since the advent of CIDR, there have been two parameters for assigning an IP address to a network interface: the address and a subnet mask. The routing complexity is increased by subnetting because to represent each locally connected subnet, there must be a separate entry in each connected router table."
"It is possible to calculate the subnet mask by hand. It is not an efficient way. Most use calculators for calculating the subnet mask. There are various types of terminator mask calculators. From those, some calculators have a better scope and wide range of functions; on the other hand, some have specific utilities."
"Information like IP address, IP range, subnet mask, and network address are provided by these tools."
Hierarchical subnets are mapped by an IPV6 IP Subnet calculator
An IPV4/IPV6 calculator/converter is an IP mask calculator. Condensed format and IPV6 alternative are supported by it. This network subnet calculator may also allow us for the conversion of IP numbers from IPV4 to IPV6.
Hex conversion tool and subnet mask adjustment is an IPV4 CIDR calculator.
"By calculating the IP address wild card mask, an IPV4 Wild card calculator calculates a portion of an IP address that is available for examination."
"For calculation of the first and last subnet addresses, we use a hex subnet calculator, including the hexadecimal notations of multicast addresses."
The small available corresponding subnet and subnet mask determined by a simple IP subnet mask calculator.
Start and end addresses are provided by a subnet range or address range calculator.
"We might use the IP or mask as a shorthand. The phrase subnet mask is preferred, for defining both the IP address and this mask at once. In this situation the number of bits in the mask follows the IP address."
"The subnet mask is used for distinguishing between the host Address and network address in IP address. It is a 32 bits long address. In this case, the subnetMask is primarily used to identify which part of an IP address is Host address and which part is the network address. By breaking into several subnets, the subnetting helps for organization of the network. The subnet mask explicitly defines the network and hostsBits as 1 and 0, respectively. In decimal notation, the value from 1 to 255 of the subnetMask represents the network address, and the zero value represents the host address."
"On the other hand, in binary notation on bit {1} of subnet mask represents the network address while off bits of Subnet mask represents the host address."
Let us take an IP address of 128.38.130.89 which belongs to the network with six subnets. Then how can we calculate the subnet mask?
Now we will determine the network class of the mentioned IP address is 128.38.130.89.
The address comes under class b because the IP address starts with 128.
"Then to define the subnets, we will calculate the number of bits."
Calculation formula: number of bits = log2(number of subnets + 2).
"Six subnets are given here. So now, we will apply the value in the above formula to get the number of bits."
Number of bits = Log2(number of subnets + 2) = log2(6+ 2) = 3 bits.
"To compose the subnet mask in the binary form, we really use the beats calculator in the above step using the default binary Classification."
"The IP address is given in this example (128.38.130.89) comes under class b. The binary classification of class b is 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000. So, then we will substitute the subnet bits in the binary classification, and we will get 11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000."
Then we will convert the binary value to its equivalent decimal value with the help of the following rule:
"If the octet contains both ""1"" and ""0"", use the formula:"
Integer number = (128 x n) + (64 x n) + (32 x n) + (16 x n) + (8 x n) + (4 x n)
"+ (2 x n) + (1 x n), where ""n"" is either 1 or 0 in the corresponding position in the octet sequence."
"After that, we will make covert this binary value to get the subnetMask."
"The application layer, which makes use of TCP (or SCTP) as a connection-oriented protocol, is actually secured by the transport layer, which also offers security for that layer. These apps' messages are first enclosed in security protocol packets before being contained in TCP. Due to the nature of security, which necessitates connection formation between the two entities, apps that employ UDP cannot take advantage of these security services. The transport-layer security does not apply to electronic mail (e-mail), which is another application. We need a particular security provision for this application because it only allows one-way communication between the sender and the receiver. This is covered in the below section."
"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are currently the two most used ones for delivering security at the transport layer. Actually, the latter is a modified version of the former by the IETF. TLS is extremely similar to SSL, which is covered in this section. The location of TLS and SSL in the Internet paradigm is depicted in the image below:"
"These protocols aim to guarantee data secrecy, data integrity, and server and client authentication, among other things. Applications-layer client/server programs that employ TCP services, like HTTP, can encapsulate their data in SSL packets (HTTPS). In order to allow HTTP messages to be encased in SSL (or TLS) packets, the client can use the URL https://... rather than http://... if the server and client are both capable of executing SSL (or TLS) programs. For example, banking information can be safely exchanged over the Internet for online buyers."
"In order to secure and compress data produced at the application layer, SSL was created. Any application-layer protocol can send data via SSL in most cases; however, HTTP is the most used one. The program sends back data that has been signed, encrypted, and compressed (optional). A trustworthy transport-layer protocol, such as TCP, receives the data at this point. In 1994, SSL was created by Netscape. In 1995, versions 2 and 3 were made available. SSLv3 is discussed in this section."
"On data that has been received from the application layer, SSL offers a number of services:"
Fragmentation - The data is first divided into blocks by SSL that are 214 bytes or shorter.
Compression - One of the lossless compression techniques agreed upon by the client and server is used to compress every data fragment. This service is not required.
Message Integrity - A keyed-hash function is used by SSL to generate a MAC in order to protect the integrity of the data.
"Confidentiality - Strictly speaking, symmetric-key cryptography is used to encrypt both the original data and the MAC in order to maintain confidentiality."
"Framing - The encrypted payload receives a header. After that, a dependable transport-layer protocol receives the payload."
"Key Exchange Algorithm - Each of the clients and servers must have a unique set of cryptographic secrets in order to exchange an authorized and confidential communication. One pre-master secret must first be created between the two parties in order to produce these secrets, though. This pre-master secret is established using one of the key-exchange protocols specified by SSL."
Encryption/Decryption Algorithm - A set of encryption and decryption techniques must also be agreed upon by both the client and the server.
"Hash Algorithm - Hash algorithms are used by SSL to ensure message integrity (message authentication). For this reason, a number of hash algorithms have been defined."
"Cipher Suite - Each SSL session has a unique cypher suite that is defined by the interaction of the key exchange, hashing, and encryption algorithms."
"Compression Algorithm - In SSL, compression is not required. There is no defined compression algorithm. Consequently, a system is free to employ any compression strategy it chooses."
"Cryptographic Parameter Generation - SSL requires six cryptographic secrets: two IVs (initialization vectors) and four keys, ensuring message integrity and confidentiality. For message authentication, encryption, and use as the initial block in calculations, the client needs one key for each. The server also requires it. A requirement of SSL is that the keys used in one direction and the other direction be distinct. The opposite way is unaffected by an attack coming from one direction. The process used to produce the parameters is as follows:"
"Two random numbers, one generated by the client and the other by the server, are exchanged between the client and server."
One pre-master secret is exchanged between the client and server using one of the established key exchange techniques.
Figure 1 illustrates how two hash algorithms (SHA-1 and MD5) are used to convert the pre-master secret into a 48-byte master secret.
"Figure 2 illustrates how the same set of hash functions is utilized to generate variable-length key material before being prepended with various constants. Up till sufficient key material is produced, the module is repeated. Keep in mind that the cypher suite chosen and the quantity of keys required for this suite determine the length of the key material block."
Figure 3 illustrates how six distinct secrets were taken from the main material.
"Sessions and Connections - A connection and a session are distinguished by SSL. A client and server are connected through a session. Following the establishment of a session, the two parties share data such the session identification, the certificate validating each of them (if necessary), the compression technique, the cypher suite, and a master secret that is used to generate keys for message authentication encryption."
"The creation of a session is required, but not sufficient for two entities to communicate with one another and exchange data. The two parties exchange two random integers while generating the keys and parameters required for transmitting messages including authentication and privacy using the master secret."
"There may be numerous connections inside a session. Within the same session, a link between two participants can be broken and then repaired. The two parties can choose to end the session when the connection is cut off, although it is not required. A session may be stopped and started again."
The network layer is the computer network component that enables the node to transfer the data packets using the connection between different nodes and devices.
The transmission of data between different devices is performed in the form of packets through different logical network paths. The network layer is the third layer of the seven-layer open system interconnection model. It provides paths to transfer the data packets in the network. The network layer also arranges and manages the possible routes for data transmission.
"The primary functions of the network layer include setting up a logical connection between the nodes, forwarding the data and routing and reporting errors during the delivery of data packets. The network layer can either support connection-oriented or connectionless networks. It cannot facilitate both types of the network simultaneously."
The network layer is also regarded as the backbone of the OSI Model. It assigns the destination and source IP address to each data segment. It arranges all the possible paths to transfer the data in the network and then chooses the best logical path to transfer the data between the different nodes.
"The network layer act upon the requests of the layer above it. The layer above it is the transport layer. Then it generates requests forwarded to the model's lower layer, that is, the data link layer. The data regarding the source and the destination host is attached to the data frame in the data link layer. But it is the work of the network layer to interconnect several networks and determine the route for data transmission."
"It only creates the logical image of the possible communication routes, and then the best route is implemented in the physical medium. Several hardware equipments is used at this layer. These devices include routers, modems, bridges, switches and several firewalls."
The network layer is available in all routers and hosting systems. The router's responsibility is to check the header fields of all the data packets transmitted from the source node to the destination node. The source node implements networking software at the network layer that adds the header to each data packet to be delivered. It sends and reads the data packet to ensure that the receiving node in the network properly manages it.
The network layer performs several functions to facilitate data transmission in a network. Some of the functions performed are as follows:
"Routing:It is the process to determine the most effective route for data transmission in the network. When a data packet arrives at the router's input link, it determines the ideal route for data transmission in the network. It determines the path that will be used to transfer the packet further in the network."
"Logical Addressing:There are two types of addressing performed in the network: logical addressing and physical addressing. The data link layer performs the physical addressing, while the network layer does the logical addressing in the OSI model. Logical addressing is also used to distinguish between the source and destination system. The network layer adds a header to the packet, which includes the logical addresses of both the sender and the receiver."
Internetworking:This is the most important function performed by the network layer of the OSI model. It establishes the logical connection between nodes in the same or different networks.
Fragmentation:It is the conversion of data packets into the smallest individual data units capable of being transmitted in the network.
Guaranteed delivery: this service ensures that the data packet transferred from a node reaches the final destination node in the network.
Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay:This service ensures that the data packet sent from the source reaches the destination node within a specific delay bound. The host determines this bound in the network.
"In-Order packets:The data is divided into packets before being transmitted to the network. This service ensures that the sequence of data packets before and after the transmission is the same. Thus, the data packets must be combined sequentially."
Guaranteed max jitter:This service guarantees that the time between two continuous transmissions is equal to the time the receiver takes to receive the two successive transmitted packets. This ensures that there is no congestion in the network.
"Security services:This layer is most vulnerable as it is directly linked to the internet. It also provides additional security measures to ensure system security in the network. This layer implements a session key between the source and destination nodes. The network layer performs the encryption on the payloads of the datagrams at the source side before transmitting them into the network. The decryption is performed at the destination end. The destination host decrypts the payload. Thus, ensuring the data integrity in the source authentication services is maintained in the network."
There are certain challenges that both the developer and the user need to pay attention to if they want to design the network layer and ensure that the network layer performs all the required functions. Some of the issues associated with the design of the network layer are as follows:
Routing Packets is the primary design decision concerned with the network layer. This is essential as it determines how the packets will be transferred from one node to another in the network.
The routes for transmitting the data in the nodes can either be static tables or dynamic tables. The routes can be predefined or modified at regular intervals.
"At any moment, if there are too many packets in the transit or the network, they will disrupt the flow of data in the network. This may create bottlenecks in the network."
"The quality of the network transmission is determined by various factors associated with the network layer, such as delays, jitter and transmission times."
The data packets may encounter several problems while transmitting the packets from one network to another. It may be possible that the two networks have different addressing schemes than the other.
Different protocols are required to facilitate communication between the two networks.
There are several merits to implementing the network layer in the OSI model. Some of the advantages of using a network layer are mentioned below:
The network layer performs packetization on the data. This makes it easier to transmit the data packets in the network. This service also ensures that the packet reaches the destination node by eliminating the single points of failure during transmission.
The router is equipment that is used in the network layer. It is responsible for creating collisions and broadcasting the domains in the network layer to reduce the traffic in the network.
The forwarding method is implemented to transmit the data packets among the different nodes in the network.
Some demerits and issues cannot be addressed in the network layer. These demerits are as follows.
The network layer design does not provide any mechanism for flow control.
"There may be instances when the network is congested because of too many datagrams in transition in the network. This may create additional burdens on the routers of the networks. If the datagrams are too many, the router may lose certain data packets in certain cases. This may lead to the loss of important information during transmission."
"Since the data packets are fragmented before being transmitted, it is impossible to implement indirect control at the network layer. This layer also lacks efficient error control mechanisms."
There are several protocols implemented in the network layer of the OSI model. These protocols are responsible for establishing a connection between nodes and networks and performing encryption and checking at the network layer. Some of these network protocols are as follows:
The IP defines the structures of the data packets that are responsible for encapsulating the data depending upon the IP addresses mentioned in the headers before delivering the data packets. It also defines the method of addressing the datagram. This method is useful as it helps identify the datagram's source and destination.
"Given below are some examples of the Network layer protocols. These protocols are implemented to determine the routes of data transmission, ensure secure communication between nodes in the same or different networks, translate the networks and implement redundancy."
"ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. This protocol assigns an IP address to the MAC address of the device. The MAC address is a unique address that can be used to uniquely identify a device. A device must have a MAC address to use a local area network. But the MAC address can be easily altered. Thus, an IP address is used instead of the MAC address on the internet. The IP address of a device cannot be changed."
"For instance, if the NIC placed on a specific device fails, then the device's MAC address will be modified, but the device's IP address will remain the same. The address resolution protocol can be used to find the device's MAC address."
"For example, if the NIC on a particular machine fails, the MAC address changes, but the IP address does not change. ARP is used to find the MAC address of the node when an internet address is known."
IGMP is an acronym used for Internet Group Message Protocol. The internet protocol provides support for two types of communication. These are as follows:
"In unicast communication, there is one sender and a single receiving node. This is a one-to-one communication, but in multicast communication, there is only one sender and numerous receiving nodes. This is a one-to-many type of communication. This protocol is implemented and used by the network's routers and hosts to support multicast communication. They use this protocol to identify the hosts available in the local network and are the members of the group. It is a component of the IP layer and has a fixed-size message. The message sent by using this protocol is encapsulated within an IP datagram."
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol. This protocol was specifically designed for IP addresses. This algorithm is based on another algorithm known as the shortest path first. The routers and the nodes in the system that are enclosed within an area maintain the same link-state database that defines the area's topology.
This distance vector routing protocol computes the hop count as the metric to compute the routing distance. The hop count represents the number of routers between the source and destination nodes. The path with the east hop count is considered the best part between the network's source and destination node. It prevents routing loops by reducing the hops allowed in a path between the source and destination.
"The principle behind NAT protocol is enabling multiple devices to access the internet using a single public address. If the device requires to access the internet, then it requires a public IP address that can be used to identify the device on the internet. To make it possible, this protocol translates the private IP addresses of the devices to the required public IP address."
"IPsec consists of two terms IP, which is an acronym for Internet Protocol, and sec stands for security. It is a combination of several protocols implemented at the network layer to establish encrypted connections between different nodes in the network. It ensures the security of the data transmitted in public networks. These protocols are used to establish virtual public networks (VPNs). They perform encryption on the IP packets. This uses authentication and data encryption to access the data packets in the network."
"It is a proprietary protocol developed by CISCO that provides redundancy for a local subset. When this protocol is implemented, one or several routers in the network acts as a virtual router. This protocol enables the user to configure two or more routers as standby routers. There is only a single router acting as the active router in the network. The rest routers only function when the active router malfunctions."
All routers placed in the same HSRP group have the same MAC and IP address. This address acts as a default gateway for the local network.
"Redundancy means the additional links that can be used to access the network nodes. It is an open standard protocol that provides redundancy in the network. The number of routers in a group acts as virtual logical routers. These routers act as the default gateway for all the local hosts in the network. If one router fails to perform its function properly or shuts down, another router from the group is assigned the responsibility of forwarding the data traffic in the network."
The network layer infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks as this layer is directly linked to the internet. The most common protocols implemented at the OSI model's network layer are Internet Protocol (IP). This layer is the most vulnerable to malicious attacks.
The attackers may launch Distributed Denial of Service attacks to create an unnecessary burden on the physical network interfaces such as routers. This may create several issues with data transmission between the networks.
"Although this comparison can be misleading, the OSI network layer is often referenced as the equivalent of the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. However, there are several differences between the two, and the TCP/IP Internet layer only has a limited amount of the functions covered by the OSI network layer."
The network layer in the OSI model uses the router to forward the data packets in the network. Each router in the network has its forwarding table. The router checks the packets header field to forward the data packet further into the network. The header field value is used to index in the forwarding table.
The value stored in the forwarding table associated with the field of the header value determines the outgoing interface link of the router to which the packet will be forwarded in the network.
"For example: if the router has a field value of 0111 approaches at a router, then the router will use the header value to determine the index in the forwarding table. The output link interface is 2. then the router will transmit the data packet to interface 2. the routing algorithm will determine the values used as the index in the forwarding table. This table can either be centralized, which is used by all the routers in the network or decentralized, that is, each router in the network will create a forwarding table of its own."
"In this networking article, we will cover the functions, advantages and disadvantages of physical layer. We will also cover the topologies and components used in the physical layer."
"In computer networking, there is a seven-layer model called the OSI model. The physical layer is the OSI model's first or base layer. The layer deals with the physical connection responsible for facilitating networks in the computer. It is related to the physical connections that connect different devices to form a network. The layer can be implemented by a chipset known as a PHY chip."
"It acts as a medium to communicate and share files between different devices in a network. It provides an electrical, mechanical, or physical means to transmit messages or resources in the network. The physical layers specify various properties of these physical connections. It specifies the properties and shape of the connecting materials. It also determines the type of electrical connections and the frequencies used for transmission. It also specifies the line of code used to transmit the data similar to the low-level parameters by the physical layers."
The physical layer in the OSI model determines the medium by which the stream of raw bits of data will be transmitted through a physical wire or connection between the different nodes in the network
The stream of bits of data is combined to form codes or symbols converted into a physical signal. This signal is transmitted through the transmission medium. The transmission medium can be any wire connecting the nodes in the network.
The layer also includes the electronic circuit technologies responsible for transmitting the data over a network. It acts as the fundamental layer that underlines the higher-level functions in the network. These functions can be implemented using various hardware technologies with numerous hardware components that may vary in characteristics.
"In the OSI model of computer networks, the task of the physical layer is to translate the logical communications requests forwarded by the data link layer and make it suitable for hardware-specific operations such as receiving and sending these signals."
The physical layer is responsible for generating the logical data packets. These data packets carry the information from the data link layer that is shared between different nodes in the computer network.
The physical layer deals with the physical aspect of the network. The major functions performed by the physical layer are as follows:
The data is transmitted in the physical layer bit by bit or symbol by symbol over a physical transmission medium.
"The physical layer also gives a standardized interface to the transmission medium. It specifies the mechanical specifications of the physical connections in the networks. The specifications include the physical capabilities of the wires and cables, such as the length of the cable. It also specifies the electrical specifications of the transmitting line, signal level, and impedance."
The layer is also responsible for determining the electromagnetic compatibility of the medium. It includes the frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum and its range. It also specifies the signal strength and the bandwidth for the transmission.
"The cables that are used to connect the nodes in the networks. Based on the above properties defined by the physical layer, these cables vary too. They can be either electrical or optical. They are only sometimes physical as they can be wireless communication links such as radio signals or free space optical communication."
Line coding is performed to convert the data into electrical signals. These electrical signals can be modulated on a different carrier wave. The flow of data is managed at the bit level. The process of managing the data at the bit level is known as bit synchronization. It is performed in synchronous serial communication and for control in asynchronous communication. It also enables sharing the transmission medium among multiple nodes in the network by using simple circuits or multiplexing.
Some complex MAC protocols enable users to share the transmission medium among different nodes. These protocols implement carrier sense and collision detection. It also uses signal processing techniques such as equalization and pulse shaping to increase the reliability and efficiency of the data transmission in the network.
The layer also determines the rate by which the data is transmitted from one node to another in the network. The rate is known as the data rate and can be different for different notes in the network.
It also is responsible for performing the synchronization of bits. It has a clock that manages both the sender and receiver by synchronizing the data at the bit level.
It also helps in deciding the direction for transferring the data. The data can be transferred in one or both directions.
"It determines the physical topology of the network. The topology of the network can be defined as the arrangement of the nodes in the network. It is determined by the network's pattern in which the nodes or devices are connected. The various types of physical topology are bus, mesh, star, and ring."
It also helps in transmission by providing a physical medium to facilitate transmission. It also takes the decisions associated with the interface of the medium.
It provides two types of configurations for data transmission. They can either be point-to-point that transmit data from one node to another or multi-point configurations that send the data to multiple nodes simultaneously.
It also provides an interface between the devices such as personal computers and other nodes in the network.
It also has a protocol for data units in bits.
"Many important devices that are essential components in the network work in the physical layer. These devices are hubs, ethernet, etc."
"The physical layer in the OSI model falls under the Hardware layer; therefore, it is responsible for handling the physical components of the networks. It is responsible for establishing and processing the connection between these network components."
"This layer is also responsible for another important process in the communication process, which is modulation. It is the process by which the data is converted into radio waves by adding it to an electrical or optical signal and making it suitable for transmission through the medium."
"It also acts as a switching mechanism where the data packets can be transferred from one port in the device to another port in a different device. The transmitting port is the sender port, and the receiving port is the destination port."
"Sequential Delivery of Data: Though the physical layer tries to send the data to the receiving node in sequential order, it does not have any error control or flow control; therefore, there are chances that the data might be lost, duplicated, or modified."
"Fault Detection: There is no mechanism to solve any fault in the physical layer; therefore, it informs the data link layer in case of any fault in the physical layer."
"Terminating the Physical Connection: when the user wants to disconnect, the physical layer disconnects the entire connection by deactivating the physical link between the nodes in the network."
Synchronization: The physical layer is incapable of performing character and frame synchronization performed by the data link layer.
It can be referred to as the geographical representation of the nodes in the network. There are four common types of physical topology in the network. The four topologies are as follows:
"Bus Topology: In a bus topology, all the devices in the network are connected through a common cable. The common cable is known as the backbone cable of the network. The connection between the nodes and the cable is made with the help of tap and drop lines. It is cheaper than the mesh and star topology. It isn't easy to reinstall or reconnect the nodes in the topology."
"Star Topology: In this topology, all the nodes in the network have a dedicated point-to-point connection with a central component that acts as a controller in the network. The central device is a hub. It is easier to set up the nodes in star topology than in mesh topology. This topology lacks fault tolerance. The entire network is dependent on the central component. If it fails, then the entire network will fail."
"Ring topology: In this topology, the nodes in the network are connected circularly using repeaters. Since it is a circular arrangement similar to a ring, it is known as a ring topology. It is only possible for a node to transmit the data to another node if the node has a token. A node must have a token to transmit the data using the network. It is the responsibility of the monitor to place the token in the ring topology."
"Mesh Topology:In this type of topology, each node in the network is connected to every other node. This means that there is a dedicated point-to-point connection between every device in the network. It is secure as every two devices have a separate connection in this topology, but it is costly and complex to install."
Point-to-Point Configuration: Each device has a one-to-one link between the nodes fully dedicated to transmitting the data between those two devices.
"Multi-Point configuration: In this configuration, there is no dedicated connection; rather, all the network nodes are connected using a single line. All the devices use the same link to transmit the data to each other."
There are three types of modes of transmission medium based on the direction the information can be transmitted in the network. These networks are as follows:
"Simplex Mode: This mode is used between two nodes where only one node can transmit the data while the other node can only receive the data. For instance, the input sends from the keyboard to the system. Television and radio broadcasting are also implemented in simplex mode."
"Half Duplex: in this mode, both devices can transmit and receive data in the network, but only one device can transmit the data at a time; that is, it is not possible for both devices to simultaneously transmit the data using this method of transmission. For example, walkie-talkies and police radios."
"Full Duplex Mode: This Mode of transmission allows both the nodes connected in the network to transmit and receive data simultaneously. For example, chatting applications, voice calls, and video conferences. Nowadays, this mode of transmission is the most used."
PHY is an abbreviation used for the physical layer. It is an electronic component in the system that is used as an integrated circuit in the system's motherboard. PHY is an essential IC to implement the functions of the physical layer in the OSI model in a network interface controller.
"The circuit establishes a connection with a link layer device known as MAC. MAC stands for medium access control. This enables the user to connect the MAC with the physical medium, such as optical fibers or copper cables. A PHY device consists of a physical coding sublayer and medium-depend layer functionality."
A PHY chip is used with a modular transceiver in fiber optic communication to form the PMA sublayer in the network model.
It is the component in the OSI model that runs at the physical layer of the network model. The component is used to implement the physical layer portion for the Ethernet connection. The function of the Ethernet PHY is to provide analog signal physical access to the physical medium or the link. Ethernet PHY is mostly interfaced with a media-independent interface. It is placed on a MAC chip in the microcontroller or another system that can perform and manage the higher-layer functions in the system.
"The primary function of the Ethernet PHY chip is to implement the hardware send and receive function of Ethernet frames. It acts as an interface between the higher layer in the system and the analog domain of the ethernet line module. The link layer is the next higher layer in the OSI model, and the data domain is digital. Thus it acts as a bridge between digital and analog data."
"The PHY is only sometimes responsible for managing the MAC addressing. The data link layer performs the MAC addressing. Similarly, the network interface card performs the BootROM and Wake on LAN functions."
"In this article, we will understand the types of Internet connection."
A user can connect to the Internet either by dialing into an ISP's computer or by directly connecting to the ISP. A dial-up connection is the one you initiate by dialing into a modem over a telephone link whereas a direct connection is a continuous connection to an ISP through a dedicated phone line.
"The DSL, Cable TV Internet, Satellite Internet and wireless Internet connections are used for providing high speed or broadband Internet access."
"A dial-up connection is one of the most common types of Internet connection offered by ISPS. This connection uses a telephone line to connect your computer to the Internet. In order to access using such a connection, a hardware device known as a modem is needed. A modem acts as an interface between your computer and a telephone line A communication program (such as Dial Up Networking) instructs the modem to place a telephone call to a specific phone number provided by an ISP, establish a connection and then connect your computer to the Internet."
"In dial-up connection, a connection is not always on. You connect only when you want to access the services provided by the Internet and when you are finished using it just disconnect."
"The dial-up connection uses either the SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol) protocols. However, most of the dial up connections are PPP protocol."
"Most ISPs support modems at a speed upto 56 kbps, so these basically used to read Emails and for Internet browsing. However, this type of connection has problems with video connections, high speed gaming and multimedia intensive websites. While using a dial up connection to access the Internet, you cannot talk on the phone. Thus a dial-up connection does not allow simultaneous talking and Internet access."
It is fast enough to read information and download small files.
It is easy to set up and most widely available Many ISPs provide this type of service.
It is the cheapest form of Internet access in a limited way.
"Very slow connection You must wait several minutes for reading e-mails with large file attachments, viewing videos on the net, listening to music and appearance of web pages containing a lot of pictures, animations etc."
Connection is not always You need to dial up every time you want to use Internet services.
"Using this connection, you cannot use the Internet and receive phone calls simultaneously. A busy signal will be received by the person who calls you."
"It is the slowest connection available, especially when multiple users on the network need to access the Internet."
"ISDN was one of the first widely available truly digital services that stands for Integrated Services Digital Network. Like a dial-up connection, it also establishes a connection to your ISP over a phone line when required. However, unlike dial-up connection it uses an upgraded phone line which carries the digital signals instead of analog signals to provide fast internet access as well as regular voice calls simultaneously. It also provides an interface for connecting other devices such as fax machines, video phones etc."
ISDN services are generally delivered in one of two techniques:
"A BRI ISDN service consists of three distinct channels on a single ISDN line: two 64 Kbps B (Bearer) channels and one 16 Kbps D (Delta or Data) channels. The B channels can carry digital data, digitized voice, images, and video at a speed of 64 Kbps. By combining two B channels, a data transfer rate upto 128 kbps may be achieved. Besides this you can use each B channel for different purposes. One may be used to talk on the phone and the other may be used to access the Internet. However, this would temporarily limit your data transmission rate (bandwidth) to 64 Kbps as only one of the B channels is used for the Internet. The D channel is intended for the purpose of signaling and control, messaging, and network management. It can also be used for packet data transmission if not in use for signaling purposes. However, it does not have the voice capability. BRI is basically used for residential, small business and telecommuting applications that are not particularly bandwidth intensive."
"PRI consists of 23 B channels plus one D channel. Both B and D channels operate at the speed of 64 Kbps making a total transmission rate of 1.544 Mpbs. This level of transmission rate is equivalent to that of T1 service. The individual B channels carry user information such as data, video, voice calls etc. and D channel is reserved for signaling information."
"In addition to T1 service, many telephone companies provide more data transmission speeds. T3 service is the one which uses 672 channels of 64 Kbps each making the total transmission speed of 44,736 Mbps. Several other fractional T services are also being provided between the levels of BRI and PRI as per the requirements of companies on the basis of their cost and needs."
"In order to connect your computer to the ISDN line, Terminal Adapters are used which are also known as ISDN modems. These modems come with phone jacks that allow you to plug in your telephone, computers, fax machine and video conferencing devices and use the ISDN line just like a normal phone line."
It is faster than dial-up connection as its maximum speed is upto 128 Kbps (HRT) compared to 56 Kbps of dial-up connection.
It allows you to access Internet and talk on the phone simultaneously
It is suitable for accessing the Internet in a LAN provided a limited number of computers(2 to 8) are attached to it.
It is not widely available as it is only available in some limited areas.
It is expensive as compared to dial-up connection as per minute charges can make it costly when a lot of Internet access is required.
It has limited expendability. It is not practical for more than 6 computers depending upon the usage.
DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line which has emerged as a new Internet access technology that has brought high connection speeds to home users and business organizations. It is one of the most common forms of broadband connection as it provides fast Internet access over ordinary telephone lines. Several versions of DSL technology are available for home and business use which is the reason why it is also known as xDSL.
"All these differ depending on their upload and download speeds, bits transfer rate, levél of service, distance, and other factors. ADSL is the most popular and widely used high speed broadband connection that allows digital information to be sent at a very high speed over ordinary phone lines. Using this connection, the same phone line is splitted into two separate channels, one for data and one for voice. Thus it allows you to talk on the phone without disconnecting from the Internet. It is called asymmetric because the download speed is different from the upload speed. These speeds vary according to the location from the phone company. Some of the common download/upload speeds are 256 Kbps/128 Kbps, 512 Kbps/128 Kbps, 1Mbps/256 Kbps etc. The speed varies from 128 Kbps to 8 Mbps and upload speed ranges from 64 Kbps to 256 Kbps."
"SDSL is like ADSI. With the difference that in the former both the upload and download speeds are the same, In order to access the Internet using this connection, DSL modem is required for the home users and DSL router is required for connecting network computers."
It is always on connection and users need not wait as in case of dialup connection.
It allows you to use a telephone and Internet simultaneously.
"It is ideal for downloading video games, watching movies online, online video conferencing etc."
It eliminates the performance overhead associated with standard dial-up connection as there is no need to convert analog signal to digital signal and digital to analog signals.
It is expensive in terms of setup and equipment costs.
Cable TV Internet Connection is a high speed Internet connection service provided through existing Cable TV lines. You can watch TV in a normal manner and at the same time access the Internet. It is one of the most widely growing services in homes because of its affordability and ease of use. The cable TV lines use the coaxial cable which transfers data at much higher speed than common telephone lines. Its speed usually ranges from 256 Kbps to 1 Mbps
"In order to access this service, a cable modem is used which is provided by a Cable TV operator. A cable modem typically has two connections, one for the Internet service and other for the Cable TV signals. These modems are specially designed so that data transmission doesn't interfere with TV signals, making it possible to use both the services simultaneously."
Cable TV Internet connections share a set amount of bandwidth with a group of customers. So the data transfer speed available to a user depends upon how many customers are using the Internet at the same time. Data transfer speeds can be extremely fast when only a few customers are online but it reduces drastically as the number of customers online increases.
Cable TV Internet Services are far more available in residential communities than in business organizations.
It provides continuous and instantaneous connectivity i.e. connection is always ON.
There is no internet login required and the user never gets busy signals as in case of dialup connection.
As the connection may be shared by multiple customers this may slow down the connection to the Internet during peak time.)
"Customers are not able to telecommunicate host websites, use video teleconferencing and many other bandwidth eating applications."
It is inexpensive as compared to other types of connections though.
"Customers sharing the same cable network with other customers poses certain security risks such as unauthorized monitoring and hacking, denial of service etc."
"Satellite Internet Connection offers yet another option for accessing the Internet. It is the most expensive alternative for getting a high speed connection to the Internet. These connections are aimed for those remote areas where other Internet connections such as dial-up. ISDN, DSL cannot be used."
"Satellite Internet connection can either be a one way connection or a two way connection. In one way connection, you can only download data but in order to upload the data you need a dialup access through an ISP over telephone line. However, in a two way connection, downloads and uploads are done by the satellite without a need of dialup connection."
"In order to use this connection, you need a satellite dish, a coaxial cable and communication software. In addition, we may also need a phone line and a dial-up Internet connection if the user has to upload also."
The download speed for these connections varies from 400 Kbps to 6 Mbps and the upload speed is limited upto a maximum of 128 Kbps.
This connection is available almost everywhere even in small villages where Cable TV connection is not possible.
Bandwidth is not shared as in case of Cable Internet Connection.
It is easy to reinstall as the dish can be easily removed and reinstalled unlike Cable TV connection where cables generally go to waste.
It is more expensive to set up than other high speed Internet Connections
"In case of one way connection, you cannot communicate on the phone when you are uploading"
"With the recent advancement in wireless technology, the high speed Internet access is not limited to the desktop but it is now accessible on laptops, PDA's, mobiles also, Wireless Internet is the broadband Internet connection that use the radio frequency bands to connect to the Internet instead of using a telephone line or a cable network. This type of connection provides a very high speed, usually more than 10 Mbps and costs considerably less than the equivalent other wired versions. Its speeds range from 256 Kbps to 10 Mbps. It is possible to use this type of connection to transmit data over long distances. This type of connection is used by business travelers and persons who are away from home as long as they are within the network's coverage area."
"(wi-fi): A number of ISP's have placed 802.11b (wi-fi) network standards in public places such as hostels, coffee shops, airports, convention centers. These networks provide easy access to the Internet for anyone with a compatible device (e.g. Laptop or PDA)."
"Bluetooth: It is also used for Internet access although it doesn't have the potential of wi-fi due to its limited distance. It was primarily promoted as it eliminated the need for cables between devices such as keyboard, computers, cellular phones, PDA's etc. The current standard allows upto 8 devices to be connected to it."
It provides greater mobility and covers a very long distance.
"It has limited availability wi-fi connection is usually available in public areas like airports,railways stations etc. Bluetooth connection is available in areas where mobile companies have network coverage."
"DEFINITION: Noise refers to any undesirable signal that corrupts or distorts the originally transmitted message in a communication system. Various factors, such as electromagnetic interference, thermal agitation, or electrical cross-talk can cause it. The presence of noise in a transmission channel reduces the quality and reliability of the received signal, making it more difficult for the receiver to decode the original message accurately. To combat the effects of noise, engineers often employ techniques such as error correction coding, signal amplification, and filtering to minimize its impact and ensure the integrity of the transmitted data."
"The signal may be distorted by a variety of noise forms, including thermal noise, generated noise, crosstalk, and impulsive noise. The random movement of electrons in a wire, known as thermal noise, results in an additional signal that was not initially sent by the transmitter. The transmission medium serves as the receiving antenna, and these devices serve as the transmitting antenna. The impact of one wire on another is known as crosstalk. The transmission antenna is one wire, while the receiving antenna is the other. Impulse noise is a spike that is caused by electrical lines, lightning, and other sources that produce signals with great energy in a brief period of time. The provided figure illustrates how noise affects a signal."
"In a communication system, the signal-to-noise ratio is an important factor in determining the reliability and accuracy of the transmitted information. The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio so that the receiver can accurately decode the original message with minimal error. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved by reducing the noise or increasing the signal strength, or by using error correction coding or signal processing techniques to filter out the noise."
We must take into account the average signal and noise powers because they could alter over time. The idea of SNR is depicted in the accompanying figure.
"Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the relative strength of a desired signal to the level of unwanted background noise in a communication system. It is expressed as the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise, and is typically measured in decibels (dB). A higher signal-to-noise ratio indicates a stronger signal compared to the noise, and therefore, better signal quality and a clearer transmission."
"The data rate in a channel can be calculated by considering the amount of information that is transmitted over the channel in a given amount of time. The formula for data rate, also known as bandwidth, is given by:"
Data Rate (R) = Total number of bits transmitted / Total time taken to transmit the bits
"The total number of bits transmitted can be calculated by multiplying the number of symbols transmitted per second by the number of bits per symbol. For example, suppose a channel uses quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In that case, the number of bits per symbol can be calculated based on the number of possible combinations of amplitude and phase levels. It's important to note that the data rate is also influenced by various other factors, such as the frequency spectrum available for transmission, the type of modulation used, and the amount of noise present in the channel. To maximize the data rate, it is often necessary to optimize the transmission scheme, use error correction coding, and employ techniques to reduce the effects of noise."
There are several factors that can affect the data rate in a communication channel. Here are three key ones:
"Channel Capacity: The channel capacity, or the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a channel, is limited by various physical and electrical constraints, such as the bandwidth of the channel, the amount of noise present, and the type of modulation used."
"Modulation Technique: Different modulation techniques can transmit data over a channel. For example, amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) has limited data rates. In contrast, more advanced techniques like quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can support higher data rates."
"Interference and Noise: Interference from other sources and background noise in the channel can have a significant impact on the data rate. These factors can cause degradation in the quality of the signal, making it more difficult for the receiver to accurately decode the information. To combat the effects of noise, engineers often employ techniques such as error correction coding, signal amplification, and filtering to minimize its impact and ensure the integrity of the transmitted data."
"Two formulas were developed, one by Nyquist and one by Shannon, to calculate the data rate in communication channels. The formula by Nyquist is designed for noise-free channels, while the formula by Shannon takes into account the presence of noise in the channel."
"A noiseless channel is a communication system in which the signal transmitted from the sender to the receiver is free from any unwanted background noise or interference. In other words, a noiseless channel is a theoretical ideal where the signal quality is perfect and the information transmitted is not degraded by any extraneous factors."
"This type of channel is often used as a reference in communications theory and engineering to understand the effects of noise on the data rate and signal quality. A noiseless channel is an idealized concept and does not exist in reality, as all communication channels are inherently subject to some form of noise or interference. However, by employing techniques such as error correction coding, signal processing, and channel equalization, it is possible to minimize the effects of noise and improve the signal quality in real-world communication systems."
The theoretical maximum bit rate for a noiseless channel is determined by the Nyquist bit rate formula:
"The equation mentioned uses three terms, bandwidth, L (representing the number of signal levels used for data representation), and BitRate (the rate at which bits are transmitted in bits per second). According to the equation, increasing the number of signal levels could result in a higher bit rate. However, this is only true in theory. In practice, there is a limit to how many signal levels can be utilized before the receiver becomes too complex and the system becomes unreliable."
"For example, when the signal only has two levels, the receiver can easily distinguish between a 0 and a 1. But as the number of signal levels increases, the receiver must be increasingly sophisticated to discriminate between them, making the system less reliable. This trade-off highlights the practical limitations of using the equation to achieve higher bit rates in real-world communication systems."
Does the bit rate predicted by the Nyquist theorem match the intuitive bit rate mentioned in baseband transmission?
"Answer - The bit rate predicted by the Nyquist theorem and the intuitive bit rate in baseband transmission may or may not match, depending on the specific communication system being considered."
"The Nyquist theorem provides a theoretical upper limit for the bit rate in a noiseless channel based on the bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. The intuitive bit rate in baseband transmission is a rough estimate of the data rate that can be achieved in a real-world communication system, taking into account practical limitations such as noise and interference."
"In a noiseless channel, the bit rate predicted by the Nyquist theorem should match the intuitive bit rate in baseband transmission. However, in a noisy channel, the bit rate predicted by the Nyquist theorem will be lower than the intuitive bit rate in baseband transmission due to the effects of noise and interference on the signal quality."
"In summary, the match between the bit rate predicted by the Nyquist theorem and the intuitive bit rate in baseband transmission will depend on the specific communication system being considered and the level of noise and interference in the channel."
"A noisy channel is a communication system in which the transmission of data is impaired by external interference or internal degradation of the signal. This interference, known as noise, can take many forms, including thermal noise, electromagnetic interference, and crosstalk."
"SHANNON CAPACITY - Shannon capacity, also known as channel capacity, is a concept in information theory introduced by Claude E. Shannon in 1948. It represents the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through a communication channel per unit of time, given the channel's characteristics and constraints. The channel capacity is expressed in bits per second (bps). It is determined by the channel's bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and the type of signaling used (e.g., binary or multi-level)."
"The channel capacity provides a theoretical upper limit for the data rate that can be achieved over a given communication channel. It is important to note that this limit is a theoretical ideal and does not take into account the practical limitations of real-world communication systems, such as noise, interference, and errors. Despite these limitations, the channel capacity remains a valuable tool for designing and analyzing communication systems, as it provides a benchmark for comparing the performance of different channels and transmission techniques."
"In practice, there is no such thing as a noiseless channel; noise is always present. The Shannon capacity is given as:"
"The Shannon capacity calculation takes into account the channel's bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and bit-per-second capacity. Unlike the number of signal levels, this formula does not include the signal level, so the channel's capacity cannot be exceeded. The formula represents a property of the channel rather than a transmission technique."
"Consider a channel that is incredibly noisy and has a signal-to-noise ratio of almost 0. Or to put it another way, the signal is weak because of the noise. The formula used to determine this channel's capacity C is?"
"As a result, this channel has no ability to transmit data, regardless of its bandwidth. In other words, it lacks the capability to carry any information."
"Several devices are connected using a network to set up reliable communication within the network. These devices are regarded as nodes in the network. These nodes can be computers, printers or wireless devices that participate in the communication in the network. These nodes can be used to share data. This increases the resources available to the nodes."
"The nodes in the network are connected using links or cables. After establishing a connection in the network, the arrangement of these nodes is regarded as the network topology. Local Area Network is an example of network topology."
"The physical topology determines the actual location of different nodes in the network. In this topology, all the network nodes are connected using physical cables. When these physical connections are mapped geometrically, and the mapping represents a certain geometric pattern, such as a ring, the star represents the network's physical topology. Some common examples of physical topology in the network are bus, star, mesh and ring topology."
"Bus topology is the line or horizontal topology in the network. It is the simplest physical orientation of nodes in the network. This topology is most used in local area networks where the link between each node is a single connection line or a cable through an interface. Thus each node in the network can communicate with the other node. The single cable connecting the entire network of nodes is known as the network's backbone. If the backbone cable is damaged, then there is a high possibility that the entire network will fail."
"Each device or workstation has a unique address of its own. In order to access a particular node in the network, the user should know the address of that node. There is no point of concentration in the bus topology. Therefore there is a severe issue associated with the resolution in the network. Traffic flow in the bus topology is simpler than in other topologies as this network allows all the workstations to get each transmission sent using the bus. Therefore, every node in the bus topology can broadcast the data over multiple workstations."
"This topology is simple to establish and easier to maintain than topologies with a relatively complex arrangement, such as mesh or star topology. It requires fewer cables to connect nodes as the whole network is linked with a single connecting wire. An example of Bus topology is the Ethernet Connection. In a bus topology, if the user wants to share the information with the last node, then the information will have to be passed through all the nodes between the sender and receiving node. Another disadvantage of using bus topology is that if the main cable connecting the nodes is damaged, the connection between all the nodes will be lost, or the network will be split."
"Instead of a cable, the user can use either a network card or a co-axial cable to connect the nodes in the network. The type of connection used depends upon the nodes in the network. When the bus topology has two ending nodes, then the topology is regarded as linear topology. In this topology, the data is transmitted in a single direction, is the communication performed is unidirectional."
"The nodes that send data in the network are regarded as the host. All the computers that are linked to the network receive the data transmitted by the host. This increases the network traffic for each node. The nodes use Media Access Technology, such as bus masters, to transmit the data in the bus. Each node in the bus network has equal priority to send data in the network."
The bus topology is the most simple network topology that can connect the network nodes. There are several use cases of this topology. Some of the real-life examples where bus topology is implemented are as follows:
"If the user wants to share data between the client and server computer, both these components should be connected to the same network."
This topology is ideal when used for establishing small networks that are used to connect limited nodes covering multiple floors. It can be used to connect the end user nodes with a server in the network.
"Devices used in the home network, such as printers, desktops or scanners, are connected using bus topology."
Small and Medium-sized businesses that cannot afford central equipment such as hubs or switches can implement bus topology without requiring additional equipment.
The topology is best suited when the nodes constantly increase in the network.
"It is used in an organization with limited resources. Since the bus cable does not require an additional power source, there is no additional cost. Moreover, they can be easily used on underground floors and pass through roof-ceiling. This saves space and the aesthetics of the office."
There are several benefits of using bus topology to establish a network. Some of the advantages are as follows:
"Compared to the other network topologies such as mesh, star or tree topology available to establish the network. It is cheaper as it does not require any additional device to set up. Moreover, the cable length required to establish bus topology is also comparatively less."
"The smaller geography limits the number of nodes connected using the bus. Therefore, it needs fewer external connections that eliminate the need to connect devices such as hubs and switches."
"The bus topology does not require any additional central equipment other than the node; therefore, there is no requirement for an additional power source to run the network. The central cable that connects all the nodes and transmits the data throughout the network does not need any terminators. Most of the components are passive, using capacitors and resistors in the network. The cable does not consume any power. Therefore, this network can be implemented if there is a power constraint."
"The user can easily use an Ethernet cable and some connectors to connect the nodes in the network. It is simple to establish bus topology as the nodes are connected using drop cables with the bus cable. The nodes are linked linearly, requiring minimum time to establish bus topology."
"It is easier to add new nodes in the network, such as Computers, Printers, and Scanners. If the nodes are physically located in the same location, each node has a working NIC (Network Interface Card). The nodes can be inked seamlessly, and the network can be used immediately once the connection is established."
"Since the nodes in the network are connected linearly, if any node in the network fails or malfunctions, it does not affect the performance of the rest of the network. The data is transmitted through the cable. It ensures that the transmission is not disrupted in case of node failure."
The user can add up to 5 cable segments to increase the network's reach. The network can easily be extended to the neighbouring physical location by using the cable segments.
"A cable segment may measure up to 5oo meters. This topology can be implemented over a distance of 2.5 kilometres. Though, the efficiency of this network is compromised by adding length or nodes in the network. It can be rectified by using repeaters in the network. The user can also connect the existing network as an extension of the bus cable."
The user can easily connect different types of nodes in the network. The operation of the nodes is simpler in the network. It also enhances the team's productivity by allowing them to use different types of nodes in the network.
The length of the bus topology is physically limited. There is a limit to the physical cable that can be used to connect the nodes in the bus topology. A maximum of five segments of cable can be used to establish a connection between the nodes.
"The length of each cable segment measures up to 500 meters. There is no maximum number of nodes that can be attached to a particular segment of the cable. This means more nodes can be connected to the network if the nodes are kept physically close to each other. Though, the network efficiency decreases with an increase in the number of nodes."
The data is transmitted to all the nodes along with the sender and receiving nodes. All the nodes in the network have access to all the data that is transmitted in the network. This compromises the data security in the network as there is no way to ensure private communication between two nodes.
"Moreover, it is difficult to implement an additional security layer in the network. All the data is transmitted using a common link connection. The whole network is vulnerable to attacks if the bus cable is compromised."
"The whole network is dependent on the central bus cable. All the nodes are connected to the bus cable the data is transmitted in the network using it only. The entire network may fail if the bus cable malfunctions. In order to transmit the data again in the network, the user first will have to rectify the error in the cable. The network can also split under certain circumstances."
"Since the whole transmission occurs through the bus cable, there is always a possibility of data collision in the network. Moreover, as the number of nodes connected in the network increases, the possibility of data collision also increases. This limits the nodes that can be connected to the network. It affects the quality of the network as the data collision may lead to data loss."
The nodes connected to the bus topology cannot interact with each other. There is no mechanism in the nodes that allow the nodes to avoid collision of the data transmitted in the network. Thereby making this topology less suitable for large networks.
A bus topology is a good option if the nodes are enclosed in a small geographical area. It can also be implemented with other network topologies to form a hybrid network forming a larger network landscape.
"The bus topology has its limitations, but it is the simplest and quickest network topology that can be used to connect the nodes in the network. The other alternative topologies are considerably more complex and difficult to set up. The bus topology can implement a collision handling system that can prevent data collision and ensure that the data from the sender is successfully delivered to the receiver. It is the responsibility of the bus master to ensure that the data is transmitted in the correct sequence."
"Various topologies increase the performance of the network. These topologies allow the user to attach certain devices, making it easier to manage the network and improve its performance. Many of these topologies are derived from bus topology. The bus topology is less frequently used nowadays due to network advancements."
"In the ring topology, the orientation of the nodes resembles a ring. The devices in this topology are connected in a circular structure and transmit the information to the other nodes based on the neighbouring nodes in the network."
"Compared to the bus topology, which has a linear structure, the ring topology is more efficient and enclosed in a circle. This topology can manage heavier loads. In this topology, the data can be transmitted in a single direction; the transfer is unidirectional. Therefore, the ring topology is a one-way network or unidirectional ring topology."
"The user can add repeaters in the ring topology when there are many nodes connected in the topology. This is done to ensure minimal data loss when transmitted from one node to another. All the nodes and devices that form the ring of the topology are collectively known as the hoop network. In this network, the data packets are transmitted from one node to another until the data packet is delivered to the final destination."
The user can make the ring topology bidirectional by using two separate connections for each node in the network. This arrangement of nodes with two wires linking each node is known as the Dual Ring Topology. There can be different types of ring topology depending on the nodes used in the network. The ring topology supports LAN and WAN depending on the network card used in the network node.
Ring topology is quite used for small and medium-sized businesses because of the features provided by this topology. Some of the features of the ring topology are as follows:
"In this topology, the user can add hardware equipment known as repeaters to amplify the transmitting signal from the sender node to the transmitting node. The user can use multiple repeaters to improve data transmission."
"The data can be transmitted only in one direction using a cable. If the user wants to use ring topology to transmit the data in both directions, then the user will have to connect each node in the network with two wires."
The data is transmitted through wires. The data is transferred sequentially. The transmission is performed bit by bit in a ring topology.
"The topology improves communication link fidelity. This means if a single cable between the nodes breaks, the other link is used to communicate in the network."
"In this topology, each node can also act as the repeater. This means the incoming signal is enhanced every time it crosses a node, which means the transmission quality is maintained throughout the network. Even if the signal travels through multiple nodes before reaching the destination node in the network. The signal strength is maintained at each point of transmission."
"This topology has an inbuilt acknowledgement device. The acknowledgement is released when the communication is completed, that is, the data packet from the sender reaches the destination node."
"Since this network uses tokens to send the data, this method ensures there is no possibility of data collision or cross-communication between the network nodes. When a network sends a token, that particular node has complete control over the network, and only the two devices, sender and receiver, are allowed to communicate simultaneously."
The data is transmitted in a single direction in the ring topology using a single cable.
"The advantage of transmitting the data in a particular direction is that there is very less chance that the user may experience data collisions during the transmission. Though other topologies may allow the user to transmit the data in both directions, this may also increase the possibility of data collision. If there is data collision in the network, then there is a high risk that some or maybe even complete data stored in the data packet may be lost. So it is necessary to avoid collisions as much as possible."
"Ring topology is simpler than other network topologies, such as mesh or tree topology, which are relatively more complex. The simplicity of the topology is an important factor to consider when arranging several nodes in the network."
"The simpler arrangement of the nodes makes it easier to perform maintenance in the network. If any component in the computer network malfunctions, it is easier to identify the component in the ring topology as it has minimal hardware equipment. The networks only require nodes and cables used to link the nodes. If there are several nodes in the network, then the user can add repeaters to the network."
"The repeaters are used to amplify the incoming signal in the network. In this topology, it is easy to add new devices and workstations. The ring topologies support unlimited growth, which means the user can always add new nodes in the network according to their requirements. Thus, the user can add new nodes and workstations in the network without affecting the current performance of the nodes."
"There is no requirement for additional equipment in the ring topology, and it requires minimal hardware equipment to establish the ring topology. The nodes are circularly connected with cables in this topology."
The cost of installing the nodes is relatively less in ring topology than installing complex network topologies that require additional components such as switches and hubs.
"The wires can be directly connected to the ports of the nodes, making them easier to set up."
Another advantage of using ring topology is that they utilize the token to transmit the data in the network.
"In similar terms, it can be described as the primary signal sent from the sender node to the receiving node that allows both nodes to establish communication by using the network. This method of establishing communication in the network is most useful when the user needs to transmit the data to other workstations in the network."
This method is more efficient in sharing the data than other methods used in different topologies.
"Since the whole data is transmitted in a single direction using a wire, the data transmission speed within the network nodes is very high in a ring topology. The data is transmitted using cables and a method known as token passing which increases the efficiency of the data transfer."
"In a ring topology, the user can implement the token-passing mechanism. In this mechanism, when a node transmits the data packet in the network, the token ring switch reads the destination from the data packets and forwards the data to the receiving node."
"As in ring topology, the user can implement token passing; the performance of ring topology is better than the bus topology when the data traffic is increased."
"Tokens are required to transmit the data in the network. It is a highly organized network. The sender must send a token first to transmit the data in the network. Since each node in the network is provided with a token, each node can transmit the data in the network."
"The data can only be transmitted in one direction using the ring topology, meaning the data packet cannot take the shortest path possible to transmit the data. The data packet must travel through all the nodes between the sender and receiver."
Interconnecting nodes form the whole network. The whole network is affected if a single node malfunctions in the network. There is also the possibility of complete network failure even when a single node fails.
"When a very large number of nodes are added to the network, it may degrade the entire network's performance. It has limited bandwidth; moreover, more nodes in the network means that the data will have to travel through more nodes to reach the destination, which will decrease the efficiency of the network due to the increased hop count."
"Since the nodes are required to send tokens before transmitting the data in the network, the performance is relatively low in ring topology than in the bus topology when the traffic is low. The nodes must wait until the control is provided to the sender node for communication."
"The communication is only feasible when all the nodes in the network are turned on. If any node between the transmission is turned off, the data packet will not be forwarded further. This consumes a lot of energy."
"Though ring topology may perform better than bus topology when the load is high, under normal conditions, its performance is slower than the bus topology. The ring topology uses sequential access, which leads to a slower access speed than the bus topology. Moreover, there are no terminators in the ring topology, while there are two terminating nodes in the bus topology."
"Though the ring topology may be cheaper than the star topology, it is relatively more expensive than other alternatives. The architecture cost is quite high in the ring topology."
"It is difficult to add or remove nodes while transmitting the data in the network. Since the data in the ring topology is passed through all the nodes between the sending and receiving nodes. If any intermediary nodes are not working, the transmission is not completed. Therefore it is difficult to add or remove nodes when the network is being used, as that may create problems in the network activity."
"The entire network depends on the single cable that is used to connect the nodes in the network. If the cable is damaged, then the entire network fails. Since there is no other cable, communication will be instantly disrupted. The user will be required to fix the cable before using the network."
"The data is passed through all the nodes in the network, making it difficult to find the node that malfunctioned. Therefore, it is difficult to troubleshoot the ring network."
"As the number of nodes increases in the ring topology, the nodes that the data will be sent during the transmission increase, which hugely impacts the performance of the network. Therefore this is not an ideal option when using many nodes. Therefore, ring topology is not scalable."
"Since there are many different topologies available and we can't deny the benefits and features offered by the ring topology, but it is not always the best physical topology available."
"The ring topology can be implemented in small and medium-sized organizations, but for large organizations, the advantages of the ring topology are outweighed by its disadvantages. These organizations may necessarily require additional equipment, such as hubs or switches, to efficiently transmit the data in the network."
The physical arrangements of the nodes in a network can be described as the network's physical topology. The nodes in the networks can be represented in several ways. Some examples of physical topologies are:
This tutorial will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of star topology in computer networks.
"Star topology is sometimes also referred to as the star network. In this physical arrangement of the nodes, each node or device in the network is linked with a central unit called a hub. This arrangement is used frequently for configuring computer networks. It is one of the most popular network topologies. Thus, all the nodes are connected to a single central unit. The equipment arrangement is similar to a star; therefore, it is referred to as the star topology."
"Since there is no direct link between any nodes in the star topology, that why, unlike mesh topology, it is not possible to communicate directly between different devices in this network. All the communication between any node in star topology is performed using a hub. The user end devices or peripheral nodes act as clients in the network, while the central equipment through which all the peripheral nodes are connected acts as the server in the network. A coaxial cable or RJ-45 wire establishes a connection in the star topology. Similar to a bus topology, it is very simple to establish the star topology. It is pretty straightforward to set up."
"Various places implement star topology networks. Some places that use this topology are Airports, Hospitals, banks and other organizations requiring a centralized management unit. The user can also use a switch as a central device instead of a hub. Since, in this arrangement, all the nodes are connected with a central unit without having any other direct link, there is a very high dependency on the central device in the star network. The whole computer network's communication fails if the network's central unit malfunctions."
There are several advantages of using star topology to connect the nodes in your computer network. Some of these advantages are mentioned below:
"In star topology, only a single node is affected when there is a NIC failure or the link between the node, and central equipment is damaged. Since all the nodes have an independent connection to the central unit, it provides an advantage to the user in case of node failure in the network. There is a single connection between the node and the central unit."
"However, this means that every node in the network requires a separate connection; therefore, this structure is relatively more expensive than other network topologies. But the cost issues are outweighed because of other additional advantages offered by the star topology."
"The entire network can only be affected under one condition when the arrangement's central unit is compromised. Only in this case, the entire network fails altogether. It is a safe network and is not readily available to the general public. This is mostly used in organizations that have several nodes for connections. This topology is used in businesses of different sizes to support their various needs."
"Sometimes, the user wants to add new devices to the network. When using star topology, adding new nodes to the network is relatively simple. It is a straightforward process to add a new addition to the existing network. The user only needs to connect the device to the central core using a direct cable. This provides an advantage to the user when they are required to connect several devices with a single core. This way, it is possible to add new devices to the network without disturbing the existing structure of the network. Both new and previously attached devices can gain benefits from their structure."
Since the whole network is dependent on the central unit as all the nodes in the network are connected or disconnected from the central unit. The user can simply maintain the productivity of the network by replacing the nodes that are no longer functioning properly. Therefore this network is highly scalable and easy to maintain.
Star topology is the best type of option available when the user wants to use several varieties of applications as nodes in the network. It allows the user to connect different types of devices to the network. Both the hub and the switch allow the devices to forward the data packets to several types of devices.
"Therefore, it is mostly used in businesses that require connecting different types of equipment with a network. It allows them to link the computer, laptops, printers and other stations using a central core."
"It also provides an option to increase the range of each device connected to the star topology. This can be done by using a server connected to the central hub. Furthermore, the user can easily link the whole office with this network configuration until each node in the office is compatible with the hardware and software of the central hub. It should also support the network connection used for communication and data transmission."
"In this network configuration, all the nodes are connected to the central core with a one-to-one connection by using a direct cable. It decreases the possibility of data collision in the network. It can also manage the situation when data collisions occur in the network and does not create bottlenecks. This means that compared to other network orientation designs, the performance of the star topology is relatively high. However, when the traffic is very high, there may be some instances where the network transmits the data very slowly."
"Another advantage of using a star topology is that the user can implement multiple approaches. This means the user can choose to implement the network by using an active hub, a passive hub or even a switch as the central core to use as the central core when designing a star topology network."
"If the user decides to use a passive hub, then it won't require the modification time of the data packets. The signal from through the nodes with any intervention in the star topology network is built using the passive hub."
"Furthermore, in addition to the responsibilities performed by the central equipment, a network built by using an active hub can perform certain additional functions."
"If the user uses a switch as the central component for the star topology network, then the data packet will only be transmitted to the intended receiving node. The switch reads the destination address of data packets and sends it to the designated node only. An active hub in the star topology can also act as the repeater in the network."
"The approach to connecting the nodes in star topology is more streamlined; therefore, it facilitates faster communication than in other topologies. Though, the other topologies may provide a higher level of reliability."
"Star topology is more flexible and can be installed in the organization confidently. Since there is a central core through which all the nodes and devices are connected, the users need not worry about communication among the devices in the network. This network can be easily implemented regardless of the size of the business and gain advantages."
"It allows the user to establish point-based connections. It supports uni-cast communication and provides a secure pathway to share the data in the network. Another benefit of using this topology is that by implementing this network, there is no risk of signal reflections. Thus, it helps to avoid point-to-point connections in the network."
The user can easily manage individual nodes in the network. It can be easily set up without disturbing the existing network. The nodes can easily be added or removed at any moment. It is easier to replace the malfunctioning units in the network. The user can also add new units to increase the productivity of the topology.
"Since the whole network depends on a central core, it is easier to monitor and manage it using a centralized management system such as a server, central computer, switch, or hub."
"We have discussed several benefits of the star topology, but there are certain disadvantages of using this topology as well. Some of these disadvantages are mentioned below:"
"Since all the nodes in the star topology are connected to the central core device, such as a hub or switch, the entire network is highly dependent on this device, making it the most important component of the network."
"If the network's central equipment fails, it may disrupt the working of the entire network. The entire network fails with the central core. In this situation, the user can perform work on the nodes offline but won't use the network. There may be instances to lessen the possibilities of collaboration immediately. If the central component malfunctions for any reason, the user may require to consider replacing the complete central core, and that can be significantly more difficult."
"It is costly to install, and as it requires a central core, extending the topology also requires purchasing additional cables for the new nodes and devices in the network. Since each device has to be connected to the core, so each requires a separate cable."
"Still, the most expensive component of this topology is the requirement of additional equipment, such as Hubs or switches that can be used as the core. It also requires additional connectors and cables. Since, each device only requires a single connection to the core, designing this topology is very simple and is quite reliable too."
The expensive cost to establish this topology is why some small businesses search for other alternative topologies in the network.
"Although this topology is more expensive than other topologies, it increases the productivity of the network and reduces the time to look down maintenance issues, which can save costs."
"The downtime is also less in this network, as each node has a separate connection with the core if the user disconnects any of the nodes in the network. The cable may be compromised by frequently disconnecting and connecting the nodes to the network."
"The primary requirement for setting up nodes in the star topology is the central core of the network. This can either be a switch to a hub. If you must implement several star topologies together, then a separate core will be required for each star network. This installation is quite expensive and can complicate the design of the network. It can also create several vulnerabilities in some star networks."
"The user can simply change the primary communication tool by removing the multi-star installation's central hub. In this arrangement, not all the network nodes will have permission to access the central database. Still, they can establish communication with other nodes available in the network."
"Most people still use wire connections to establish a connection between different devices, even when the wireless star topology is available in modern times. When cables connect the network nodes, the cable's limited length limits the moment of these nodes. It is difficult to move the nodes. Users cannot move their workstations to stay productive as the network is stationary. Moreover, the user will have to move from the workstations whenever required to use other equipment connected to the network, such as a printer. The central hub is bound to a particular distance from the other nodes, reducing the productivity level over time as the user will have to move from their place to reach other nodes."
"Generally, adding new devices to the star topology is simpler, but it can be difficult to add wireless devices such as smartphones and other mobile devices. Moreover, some personal computer does not allow them to connect to the star topology."
"Most of the central hubs available do not have a port that allows them to connect the internet with the system. So, if the user wants to connect the nodes to the internet, they will have to rely on a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to stay online. This means it is relatively hard to collaborate on projects using the star network if the organizations have workers who work with their mobile phones or have remote offices."
If someone tries to connect with the LAN without having an inside connection will have several issues than the ones that use a cable connection to communicate outside of the organization.
"The cable used to connect the nodes and the central switch or hub in the star network is prone to damage. Usually, the nodes are separated in the organization, and the central hub is located in a different room. Therefore, the cable responsible for connecting the peripheral devices in the network must go under walls, through the walls or pass other obstacles when establishing the network."
"Moreover, when the weather of the surroundings changes, it may also impact the performance of the wire or cable if the LAN is required to be installed on the external building. This can make it difficult to find the damage in the wire. This hugely impacts the reliability of the star topology. Damage to the wires connecting the nodes and core can occur for various reasons. The damage in the wires can be reduced by adding a protective layer. The user can increase the strength of the wire by bundling the wires."
"The entire network depends on the central core, such as a hub or switch. If the central core of the star topology fails, then the entire network of nodes fails with it. Each node in the network is dependent on the central device to communicate with each other. This is the major disadvantage of the star network, and that's why it is necessary to maintain the central device."
"Since the nodes are connected to the hub, the hub should be maintained all the time in order to transmit the data from the sender to the receiver. Therefore star topology requires more resources and regular maintenance to ensure the hub is working."
"Usually, the star topology uses wired connections, but when it is impossible to physically connect the nodes, the users can implement wireless star topology. There is a serious concern associated with this star topology."
The wireless star topology cannot handle heavy traffic as this network's data transfer is quite low. The user must use wired connections to work with the heavy load. The slow transmission rate increases the possibility of bottlenecks in the WLAN.
"Moreover, if the user wants to set a limit on the network, then the user must perform the settings manually. This means the user will have to spend more time setting up the system. This, in turn, decreases the user's productivity as they have to manage the network along with the project."
Another issue with the wireless star network is that it is relatively difficult to find and resolve the problem in the network. Sometimes the cost of investing in wires is worth more than using a wired network.
The network layer is the computer network component that enables the node to transfer the data packets using the connection between different nodes and devices.
The transmission of data between different devices is performed in the form of packets through different logical network paths. The network layer is the third layer of the seven-layer open system interconnection model. It provides paths to transfer the data packets in the network. The network layer also arranges and manages the possible routes for data transmission.
"The primary functions of the network layer include setting up a logical connection between the nodes, forwarding the data and routing and reporting errors during the delivery of data packets. The network layer can either support connection-oriented or connectionless networks. It cannot facilitate both types of the network simultaneously."
The network layer is also regarded as the backbone of the OSI Model. It assigns the destination and source IP address to each data segment. It arranges all the possible paths to transfer the data in the network and then chooses the best logical path to transfer the data between the different nodes.
"The network layer act upon the requests of the layer above it. The layer above it is the transport layer. Then it generates requests forwarded to the model's lower layer, that is, the data link layer. The data regarding the source and the destination host is attached to the data frame in the data link layer. But it is the work of the network layer to interconnect several networks and determine the route for data transmission."
"It only creates the logical image of the possible communication routes, and then the best route is implemented in the physical medium. Several hardware equipments is used at this layer. These devices include routers, modems, bridges, switches and several firewalls."
The network layer is available in all routers and hosting systems. The router's responsibility is to check the header fields of all the data packets transmitted from the source node to the destination node. The source node implements networking software at the network layer that adds the header to each data packet to be delivered. It sends and reads the data packet to ensure that the receiving node in the network properly manages it.
The network layer performs several functions to facilitate data transmission in a network. Some of the functions performed are as follows:
"Routing:It is the process to determine the most effective route for data transmission in the network. When a data packet arrives at the router's input link, it determines the ideal route for data transmission in the network. It determines the path that will be used to transfer the packet further in the network."
"Logical Addressing:There are two types of addressing performed in the network: logical addressing and physical addressing. The data link layer performs the physical addressing, while the network layer does the logical addressing in the OSI model. Logical addressing is also used to distinguish between the source and destination system. The network layer adds a header to the packet, which includes the logical addresses of both the sender and the receiver."
Internetworking:This is the most important function performed by the network layer of the OSI model. It establishes the logical connection between nodes in the same or different networks.
Fragmentation:It is the conversion of data packets into the smallest individual data units capable of being transmitted in the network.
Guaranteed delivery: this service ensures that the data packet transferred from a node reaches the final destination node in the network.
Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay:This service ensures that the data packet sent from the source reaches the destination node within a specific delay bound. The host determines this bound in the network.
"In-Order packets:The data is divided into packets before being transmitted to the network. This service ensures that the sequence of data packets before and after the transmission is the same. Thus, the data packets must be combined sequentially."
Guaranteed max jitter:This service guarantees that the time between two continuous transmissions is equal to the time the receiver takes to receive the two successive transmitted packets. This ensures that there is no congestion in the network.
"Security services:This layer is most vulnerable as it is directly linked to the internet. It also provides additional security measures to ensure system security in the network. This layer implements a session key between the source and destination nodes. The network layer performs the encryption on the payloads of the datagrams at the source side before transmitting them into the network. The decryption is performed at the destination end. The destination host decrypts the payload. Thus, ensuring the data integrity in the source authentication services is maintained in the network."
There are certain challenges that both the developer and the user need to pay attention to if they want to design the network layer and ensure that the network layer performs all the required functions. Some of the issues associated with the design of the network layer are as follows:
Routing Packets is the primary design decision concerned with the network layer. This is essential as it determines how the packets will be transferred from one node to another in the network.
The routes for transmitting the data in the nodes can either be static tables or dynamic tables. The routes can be predefined or modified at regular intervals.
"At any moment, if there are too many packets in the transit or the network, they will disrupt the flow of data in the network. This may create bottlenecks in the network."
"The quality of the network transmission is determined by various factors associated with the network layer, such as delays, jitter and transmission times."
The data packets may encounter several problems while transmitting the packets from one network to another. It may be possible that the two networks have different addressing schemes than the other.
Different protocols are required to facilitate communication between the two networks.
There are several merits to implementing the network layer in the OSI model. Some of the advantages of using a network layer are mentioned below:
The network layer performs packetization on the data. This makes it easier to transmit the data packets in the network. This service also ensures that the packet reaches the destination node by eliminating the single points of failure during transmission.
The router is equipment that is used in the network layer. It is responsible for creating collisions and broadcasting the domains in the network layer to reduce the traffic in the network.
The forwarding method is implemented to transmit the data packets among the different nodes in the network.
Some demerits and issues cannot be addressed in the network layer. These demerits are as follows.
The network layer design does not provide any mechanism for flow control.
"There may be instances when the network is congested because of too many datagrams in transition in the network. This may create additional burdens on the routers of the networks. If the datagrams are too many, the router may lose certain data packets in certain cases. This may lead to the loss of important information during transmission."
"Since the data packets are fragmented before being transmitted, it is impossible to implement indirect control at the network layer. This layer also lacks efficient error control mechanisms."
There are several protocols implemented in the network layer of the OSI model. These protocols are responsible for establishing a connection between nodes and networks and performing encryption and checking at the network layer. Some of these network protocols are as follows:
The IP defines the structures of the data packets that are responsible for encapsulating the data depending upon the IP addresses mentioned in the headers before delivering the data packets. It also defines the method of addressing the datagram. This method is useful as it helps identify the datagram's source and destination.
"Given below are some examples of the Network layer protocols. These protocols are implemented to determine the routes of data transmission, ensure secure communication between nodes in the same or different networks, translate the networks and implement redundancy."
"ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. This protocol assigns an IP address to the MAC address of the device. The MAC address is a unique address that can be used to uniquely identify a device. A device must have a MAC address to use a local area network. But the MAC address can be easily altered. Thus, an IP address is used instead of the MAC address on the internet. The IP address of a device cannot be changed."
"For instance, if the NIC placed on a specific device fails, then the device's MAC address will be modified, but the device's IP address will remain the same. The address resolution protocol can be used to find the device's MAC address."
"For example, if the NIC on a particular machine fails, the MAC address changes, but the IP address does not change. ARP is used to find the MAC address of the node when an internet address is known."
IGMP is an acronym used for Internet Group Message Protocol. The internet protocol provides support for two types of communication. These are as follows:
"In unicast communication, there is one sender and a single receiving node. This is a one-to-one communication, but in multicast communication, there is only one sender and numerous receiving nodes. This is a one-to-many type of communication. This protocol is implemented and used by the network's routers and hosts to support multicast communication. They use this protocol to identify the hosts available in the local network and are the members of the group. It is a component of the IP layer and has a fixed-size message. The message sent by using this protocol is encapsulated within an IP datagram."
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol. This protocol was specifically designed for IP addresses. This algorithm is based on another algorithm known as the shortest path first. The routers and the nodes in the system that are enclosed within an area maintain the same link-state database that defines the area's topology.
This distance vector routing protocol computes the hop count as the metric to compute the routing distance. The hop count represents the number of routers between the source and destination nodes. The path with the east hop count is considered the best part between the network's source and destination node. It prevents routing loops by reducing the hops allowed in a path between the source and destination.
"The principle behind NAT protocol is enabling multiple devices to access the internet using a single public address. If the device requires to access the internet, then it requires a public IP address that can be used to identify the device on the internet. To make it possible, this protocol translates the private IP addresses of the devices to the required public IP address."
"IPsec consists of two terms IP, which is an acronym for Internet Protocol, and sec stands for security. It is a combination of several protocols implemented at the network layer to establish encrypted connections between different nodes in the network. It ensures the security of the data transmitted in public networks. These protocols are used to establish virtual public networks (VPNs). They perform encryption on the IP packets. This uses authentication and data encryption to access the data packets in the network."
"It is a proprietary protocol developed by CISCO that provides redundancy for a local subset. When this protocol is implemented, one or several routers in the network acts as a virtual router. This protocol enables the user to configure two or more routers as standby routers. There is only a single router acting as the active router in the network. The rest routers only function when the active router malfunctions."
All routers placed in the same HSRP group have the same MAC and IP address. This address acts as a default gateway for the local network.
"Redundancy means the additional links that can be used to access the network nodes. It is an open standard protocol that provides redundancy in the network. The number of routers in a group acts as virtual logical routers. These routers act as the default gateway for all the local hosts in the network. If one router fails to perform its function properly or shuts down, another router from the group is assigned the responsibility of forwarding the data traffic in the network."
The network layer infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks as this layer is directly linked to the internet. The most common protocols implemented at the OSI model's network layer are Internet Protocol (IP). This layer is the most vulnerable to malicious attacks.
The attackers may launch Distributed Denial of Service attacks to create an unnecessary burden on the physical network interfaces such as routers. This may create several issues with data transmission between the networks.
"Although this comparison can be misleading, the OSI network layer is often referenced as the equivalent of the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. However, there are several differences between the two, and the TCP/IP Internet layer only has a limited amount of the functions covered by the OSI network layer."
The network layer in the OSI model uses the router to forward the data packets in the network. Each router in the network has its forwarding table. The router checks the packets header field to forward the data packet further into the network. The header field value is used to index in the forwarding table.
The value stored in the forwarding table associated with the field of the header value determines the outgoing interface link of the router to which the packet will be forwarded in the network.
"For example: if the router has a field value of 0111 approaches at a router, then the router will use the header value to determine the index in the forwarding table. The output link interface is 2. then the router will transmit the data packet to interface 2. the routing algorithm will determine the values used as the index in the forwarding table. This table can either be centralized, which is used by all the routers in the network or decentralized, that is, each router in the network will create a forwarding table of its own."
"The study of protocols is divided into two categories: those that can be applied to channels with no noise or errors and those that can be applied to channels with noise or errors. Although the first group of protocols cannot be applied in real-world situations, they provide a foundation for protocols for noisy channels."
"A protocol refers to a defined set of guidelines and regulations that control the communication between different devices in a network. These guidelines specify the way in which data is formatted, timed, sequenced, and checked for errors during transmission."
"Protocols play a crucial role in ensuring accurate, efficient, and clear communication between devices. They make it possible for devices of different types and brands to communicate with each other, and they provide a consistent method for transmitting data across a network."
"Headers are responsible for selecting protocols, which are rules governing communication between devices in a network. These headers contain information describing the message's nature and the handling it will receive. To detect any issues, the headers must include information such as the message's checksum, destination, and source addresses, and other necessary header addresses."
"1. SIMPLEST Protocol - A simple protocol for a noiseless channel would be one that involves the direct transfer of data from the source to the destination without any intermediate processing. In this scenario, the channel is assumed to be noise-free, which means that the data transmitted remains intact and does not get corrupted. In a noiseless channel, a simple protocol could consist of a straightforward method for transmitting data, such as sending one bit at a time, with no error correction or flow control mechanisms in place. This type of protocol is ideal for a noiseless channel as the lack of noise ensures that the data transmitted is received accurately, making the implementation of additional measures unnecessary."
"The simplest protocol does not have any mechanisms for controlling the flow of data or detecting and correcting errors, as it is only used in noise-free channels. The protocol assumes that the receiver is always ready to process any data frames sent by the sender immediately. This type of protocol, which only allows data to flow from the sender to the receiver, is known as a one-way protocol. Since this protocol is unidirectional, there is no need for an acknowledgment or confirmation of receipt. Furthermore, because there is no data loss during transmission, there is no need to resend or retransmit the data."
"In order to create the simplest protocol, the following presumptions have been made:"
"There is no noise whatsoever in the broadcast channel (a channel with no duplications, lost frames, or corrupted frames)."
"The assumption is that the transmission route is perfect, with no instances of data loss, duplication, or corruption."
The sender's and receiver's end have an endless amount of buffer space for the frames.
"The processing time for this technique is quite brief. So, it may be disregarded."
Each party is constantly prepared to send and receive data.
"Without giving the recipient any thought, the sender delivers a series of data frames."
"No data loss occurs, hence neither an ACK nor a NACK is sent."
The data is transferred to the following layer right away by the DLL at the receiving end after the frame header has been deleted.
"In the absence of an ACK or NACK, the sender must wait a pre-determined time before transmitting the message. To solve this issue, a different protocol known as the Sliding Window Protocol is used. The sliding window protocol is a data connection layer protocol that allows for the sequential and reliable transmission of data frames. This protocol allows the sender to transmit multiple frames at once by utilizing sequence numbers. The sequence numbers are assigned to each data frame by the sender to ensure proper ordering in the event that a frame needs to be retransmitted. This also enables the receiver to detect lost or damaged packets."
"A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the flow of data in a system. In the context of the simplest protocol, a DFD can illustrate the movement of data between the sender and the receiver. The DFD would show how the sender sends the data frames to the receiver, how the receiver processes the data, and what happens if any errors occur during the transfer. It could also show the absence of flow control and error control mechanisms, which are typically included in more complex protocols. The DFD can help to clarify the basic functioning of the simplest protocol, making it easier to understand and implement."
"An illustration of a Stop-and-wait protocol-based exchange is shown in this figure. It's still simple to understand. Following the transmission of a frame, the sender awaits the receiver's answer. Send the following frame after waiting for the acknowledgment, or ACK, from the receiving end. Keep in mind that every time there are two frames, the sender is involved in four events and the receivers are involved in two events."
"2. STOP-AND-WAIT Protocol - Stop and wait is a protocol that is used for reliable data transmission in a noiseless channel. In this protocol, the sender sends a single packet at a time and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next packet. This way, the sender can ensure that each packet is received by the receiver and has been successfully processed. If the sender does not receive an ACK within a certain time frame, the packet is considered lost and must be retransmitted."
"The stop and wait protocol is simple and efficient, but it has one major drawback. Because only one packet can be transmitted at a time, the overall data transmission rate is relatively slow. To overcome this limitation, the sliding window protocol was developed. In the sliding window protocol, multiple packets can be transmitted at the same time, allowing for faster data transmission. Despite this limitation, the stop and wait protocol is still widely used in many applications due to its simplicity and reliability."
"The flow of data frames at the receiver side may become too fast for it to be processed, causing the need for temporary storage."
"However, the limited storage space of the receiver may result in the loss or discarding of frames, or even denial of service."
"To prevent this, the sender must slow down their rate of transmission, which is achieved through the use of ACK messages from the receiver."
"The sender sends a single frame and waits for confirmation from the receiver before sending the next one, adding flow control to the previous protocol."
"The communication remains unidirectional for data frames, but ACK frames flow in the opposite direction."
The flow diagram of the Stop-and-wait protocol in a noiseless channel involves the following steps:
The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.
The receiver sends an ACK to the sender to confirm receipt of the data frame.
"The sender continues to transmit the next data frame, repeating the process from step i."
"In this protocol, the sender sends one frame at a time and stops until it receives an ACK from the receiver. This prevents the receiver from becoming overwhelmed with incoming frames and ensures reliable data transmission. Additionally, the ACK frames are used for flow control, allowing the sender to adjust the transmission rate based on the receiver's processing capacity."
"The main difference between the two protocols is that the Simplest Protocol has no flow control and error control mechanisms, while the Stop-and-Wait Protocol employs a flow control mechanism through the use of ACK frames."
"In the Simplest Protocol, the recipient is always expected to be ready to receive any frames sent by the sender, so no acknowledgment is needed. In the Stop-and-Wait Protocol, the sender must wait for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next frame."
"Another difference between the two protocols is that the Simplest Protocol is unidirectional, while the Stop-and-Wait Protocol is bi-directional. In the Simplest Protocol, data frames can only move in one direction, from sender to receiver, while in the Stop-and-Wait Protocol, both data frames and ACK frames can travel in both directions."
"In conclusion, the Simplest Protocol is a basic and straightforward protocol suitable for noiseless channels, while the Stop-and-Wait Protocol adds additional reliability through flow control mechanisms and is more suitable for noisy channels."
"A Noisy Channel Protocol is a type of communication protocol that is used in communication systems where the transmission channel may introduce errors into the transmitted data. This type of protocol is designed to deal with errors in the communication channel and ensure that the data being transmitted is received accurately at the receiver end. The main objective of Noisy Channel Protocols is to minimize the error rate in the transmitted data by using techniques such as error detection and correction, flow control, and retransmission of lost or corrupted data frames. Some examples of Noisy Channel Protocols include the Stop-and-Wait Protocol, the Sliding Window Protocol, and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol."
"1. STOP-AND-WAIT ARQ Protocol - The Stop and Wait protocol is a protocol used for reliable data transmission over a noisy channel. In this protocol, the sender only sends one frame at a time and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next frame. This helps to ensure that the receiver receives the data correctly and eliminates the need for retransmission in the case of errors caused by the noisy channel. The sender continuously monitors the channel for errors, and if an error is detected, it waits for the next ACK before resending the frame. This protocol adds error control to the basic unidirectional communication of data frames and ACK frames in the opposite direction."
A data flow diagram in the Stop-and-Wait protocol in a noisy channel can be used to describe the flow of data between the sender and the receiver. This diagram generally includes the following components:
"Sender: The sender sends data frames one at a time, and waits for a response (ACK or NACK) from the receiver before sending the next data frame."
"Receiver: The receiver receives the data frames and processes them. If the frame is received correctly, the receiver sends an ACK signal to the sender. If the frame is not received correctly, the receiver sends a NACK signal to the sender."
"Noisy Channel: The noisy channel is the medium through which the data frames are transmitted from the sender to the receiver. The channel can add noise to the data frames, resulting in errors and corruption of the data."
Error Detection: The receiver uses error detection techniques such as checksums to detect errors in the received data frames.
"Error Correction: If an error is detected, the receiver sends a NACK signal to the sender, requesting a retransmission of the frame."
"In this protocol, the sender only sends one data frame at a time and waits for a response from the receiver before sending the next frame. This ensures that the receiver has enough time to process each frame before receiving the next one. The Stop-and-Wait protocol is reliable, but has low throughput compared to other protocols."
"2. GO-BACK-N ARQ Protocol - The Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol is a type of error-control protocol used in data communication to ensure reliable delivery of data over a noisy channel. In a noisy channel, the probability of errors in the received packets is high, and hence, there is a need for a mechanism to detect and correct these errors."
"The Go-Back-N ARQ protocol is a type of sliding window protocol where the sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, and the receiver sends back an acknowledgment (ACK) to the sender indicating successful receipt of the packets. In case the sender does not receive an ACK within a specified timeout period, it retransmits the entire window of packets."
The flow diagram that illustrates the operation of the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol in a noisy channel:
"The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, starting with sequence number i and ending with sequence number i + N - 1, where N is the window size."
The sender sets a timer for each packet in the window.
The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.
"If a packet is received correctly, the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender with the sequence number of the next expected packet."
"If a packet is received with errors, the receiver discards the packet and sends a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender with the sequence number of the next expected packet."
"If the sender does not receive an ACK before the timer for a packet expires, the sender retransmits the entire window of packets starting with the packet whose timer expired."
The sender resets the timer for each packet in the window.
"If the sender receives a NAK from the receiver, the sender retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received by the receiver."
The sender resets the timer for each packet that was retransmitted.
The above steps are repeated until all packets have been successfully received by the receiver. The Go-Back-N ARQ protocol provides a reliable mechanism for transmitting data over a noisy channel while minimizing the number of retransmissions required.
"3. SELECTIVE REPEAT ARQ Protocol - The Selective Repeat ARQ protocol is a type of error-control protocol used in data communication to ensure reliable delivery of data over a noisy channel. Unlike the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol which retransmits the entire window of packets, the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received."
"In the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol, the sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, and the receiver sends back an acknowledgment (ACK) to the sender indicating successful receipt of the packets. If the receiver detects an error in a packet, it sends a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender requesting retransmission of that packet."
"In the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol, the sender maintains a timer for each packet in the window. If the sender does not receive an ACK for a packet before its timer expires, the sender retransmits only that packet."
"At the receiver side, if a packet is received correctly, the receiver sends back an ACK with the sequence number of the next expected packet. However, if a packet is received with errors, the receiver discards the packet and sends back a NAK with the sequence number of the packet that needs to be retransmitted."
"Unlike Go-Back-N ARQ, in Selective Repeat ARQ, the receiver buffer is maintained for all packets that are not in sequence. When a packet with a sequence number different from the expected sequence number arrives at the receiver, it is buffered, and the receiver sends an ACK for the last in-order packet it has received."
"If a packet with a sequence number that the receiver has already buffered arrives, it is discarded, and the receiver sends an ACK for the last in-order packet it has received."
"In summary, the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol provides a reliable mechanism for transmitting data over a noisy channel while minimizing the number of retransmissions required. It retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received and buffers packets that arrive out of order to reduce the number of retransmissions required."
The flow diagram that illustrates the operation of the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol in a noisy channel:
"The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, starting with sequence number i and ending with sequence number i + N - 1, where N is the window size."
The sender sets a timer for each packet in the window.
The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.
"If a packet is received correctly and is in order, the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender with the sequence number of the next expected packet."
"If a packet is received with errors or is out of order, the receiver discards the packet and sends a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender with the sequence number of the packet that needs to be retransmitted."
The receiver buffers out-of-order packets and sends an ACK for the last in-order packet it has received.
"If the sender does not receive an ACK before the timer for a packet expires, the sender retransmits only that packet."
"If the sender receives a NAK from the receiver, the sender retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received."
The sender resets the timer for each packet that was retransmitted.
"The above steps are repeated until all packets have been successfully received by the receiver. The Selective Repeat ARQ protocol provides a reliable mechanism for transmitting data over a noisy channel while minimizing the number of retransmissions required. It retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received, and buffers out-of-order packets to reduce the number of retransmissions required."
The sender transmits one packet at a time and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next packet.
"If the ACK is not received within a certain time, the sender retransmits the packet."
"Suitable for channels with low error rates, low data rates, and short transmission distances."
The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver.
"If the receiver detects an error in a packet, it sends a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender requesting retransmission of that packet, as well as all subsequent packets in the window."
The sender retransmits the entire window of packets that were not correctly received.
Suitable for channels with moderate to high error rates and moderate data rates.
The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver.
"If the receiver detects an error in a packet, it sends a NAK to the sender requesting retransmission of that packet only."
The sender retransmits only the packets that were not correctly received.
The receiver buffers out-of-order packets to reduce the number of retransmissions required.
"Suitable for channels with moderate to high error rates, high data rates, and long transmission distances."
"In summary, Stop-and-Wait ARQ is the simplest and most reliable protocol but not suitable for high data rates. Go-Back-N ARQ is suitable for channels with moderate to high error rates, and Selective Repeat ARQ is suitable for high data rates and long transmission distances. The choice of protocol depends on the characteristics of the communication channel and the requirements of the application."
"Topology describes the orientation of the nodes in the network. Mesh topology is also a type of physical network topology. In this topology, all the nodes of the network are interlinked with each other. The connections between these nodes are established randomly. These nodes can be desktops, laptops, switches, hubs, or any other device that can be connected to the network."
"The primary advantage of using mesh topology is that even when a node fails, the network does not fail. It means that other nodes can effectively perform communication using the network. This network topology is quite expensive to set up. Moreover, the network nodes have no hierarchy, interdependency, or uniform pattern. It is a complex network and comparatively more difficult to establish than the other alternatives available."
"All the nodes in the mesh topology can send their signals into the network. Each node is also responsible for relaying the signals from other nodes. Wireless and wired networks support this topology, mostly used for wireless nodes. It is because the cables are quite expensive. Each node is connected to every other node, which means there is a point-to-point connection between each node in the mesh topology of the network."
Given below is an illustration of the mesh topology in the network.
"In this topology, all nodes act as the router in the network. This means each node determines the route to which the data transmission will occur. This is determined based on the available connection in the nodes."
"If there is a break in the network cable, the data traffic passing through the particular cable is redistributed among the nodes. It ensures that the network is always available for all the nodes in the network."
"This topology offers redundancy in the network.It is a type of network topology that offers redundant links across the network, but it is rarely used due to the work involved in having a network and the high cost, as the network components are directly connected to every other component."
Depending upon the connection of different nodes in the network. The mesh topology can be distinguished between full and partial mesh topologies. Both these types of mesh topology are described below:
"Full Mesh Topology: In this mesh topology, all the nodes in the network are connected with all the other nodes in the network. Every node in this network will have n-1 connections, where n is the number of nodes. Thus, the total number of connections in the network is n(n-1). The network is usually used as a reserve for the network backbone. This provides a lot of redundancy in the network. Redundancy means several paths are available for the data to reach from a sender to a receiver. However, this topology can be quite expensive to implement. The cost of implementation is overlooked because it enables the user to use the network when a node fails. The traffic load is distributed again to other nodes in such a situation."
"Partial Mesh Topology: In this topology, all the nodes do not have a separate connection with other nodes. Only a few nodes are connected with every remaining node in the network. This means it is not necessary to connect all the devices. This reduces the codes for establishing the network. This network usually implements the peripheral network through which they work with a full mesh backbone. Though it is less redundant than the full mesh network, it provides some level of redundancy in the network."
There are two principles based on which the mesh topology is implemented. These principles are as follows:
"This function determines the path of the data packet. The routing principle is implemented before transmitting the data packet in the network. The data packets are sent through a prearranged path consisting of several nodes. The data packet is sent through these nodes to reach the destination node. In order to successfully transmit the data, all the intermediary nodes and all the intermediate nodes should be active during transmission. They should be connected to the previous and next nodes in the transmission path."
"The other principle to implementing the mesh topology is known as flooding. In flooding, the data is transmitted to every active node in the network. If the data packet is addressed to the node, then the destination node will accept the packet, but if it is not addressed to the node, it is passed to the next node in the network path."
The protocols necessary to implement the mesh topology are present in the three layers of the OSI model. These protocols define the standards required to communicate between two nodes. The protocols can be defined as the set of rules that must be implemented to facilitate communication between devices.
The three protocols used to implement mesh topology are as follows:
Each of the protocols mentioned above plays a crucial role in implementing the network through its features and increases the performance and scalability of the network.
"Proactive Protocol:The function of this protocol is to provide self-monitoring for the nodes in the network. It is done by taking feedback from the nodes in the network. If a node fails in the network, it is responsible for initiating the path rerouting and avoiding the particular node. This protocol improves the performance of the network as it maximizes the uptime of the network. It recovers the network after failure and provides robust performance. When implemented in a dynamic environment then, this protocol uses more resources and there is a possibility of collision. But when implemented in the static environment, the protocols work ideally. It is because the path of the network is not usually altered in a static environment. Therefore, the user should ensure the protocol is implemented in a suitable environment for optimal performance."
Hybrid Protocol: this protocol provides the best option depending on the environment and communication requirements. This protocol uses reactive methods along with the features of the proactive protocol. This can reduce the cost of network operations by implementing the hybrid protocol.
"Reactive Protocol: This protocol decides the network path for the data packets sent from the source to the destination node. This operation is performed at the time when the node request for data transmission in the network. The function of this protocol includes ensuring that the path selected is the most optimal. It scans the entire network of nodes to find all the possible paths to transfer the data packets from one node to another. Since this protocol is more scalable than other protocols used to implement mesh topology, it is more suited for implementation in a dynamic environment."
"Mesh topology is established by interconnecting the devices in the network. If any connection between the nodes fails, then the traffic in the connection is redistributed to ensure that the data is transmitted to the destined nodes. This is the best way to implement the primary connections of the network as it eliminates the concerns regarding any node or connection failure. Wireless connections implemented these days are an example of mesh topology."
There are several benefits of establishing a network in a mesh topology. Some of these advantages are as follows:
"Handle a High Level of Data Traffic: this topology does not have a hierarchy. This means that if any node in the network tries to connect with another node, it can directly benefit from the routing ability of the node. This is possible because there is no hierarchy in the mesh topology."
"Node or Connection Failure Does Not Affect the Network: Mesh topology is more resistant to network failure than any other topology. The data packets are transmitted to all the nodes in the network. Each node has its routing table and translates the information mentioned in the data packet. The nodes are interconnected with all the other nodes in the network. There is redundancy in the network. Therefore even when a node or connection between two nodes fails or malfunctions, the traffic of the particular node or connection is redistributed in the network."
"Consistent Data Transfer: since there are several paths connecting two nodes in the network. In a mesh topology, the primary requirement is to connect a node with all other nodes in the network. The network constructs several paths two connect two nodes in the network. Therefore the overall data transmitted over the network is always consistent in the network. If there is more traffic in a particular path, the data can be redirected to other paths in the network. Even when some nodes in the network malfunction, the network can choose another pathway to transmit the data."
"Easy To Add New Nodes In the Network: Adding new devices to the network is easy. Mesh topology allows the user to add new devices to the network without disturbing the existing network. This means when the user introduces a new node to the network, the data currently being transmitted is not disrupted. Moreover, since all the nodes are connected, removing a node also does not affect or disrupt the flow of the existing network."
Easily Scalable: No additional equipment is required to connect nodes in the mesh topology. Each node acts as the router in the network by developing its routing table. The nodes transmit the data to all the connecting nodes to determine the possible pathways to other nodes in the network. This allows the user to change the network size easily. The user can add not only new nodes but also add new technology in the network. The addition can be made without affecting the current speed of operation.
Easy to Implement Mesh Topology: Implementing the mesh topology in the network is easy without any trouble. The user is only required to connect the nodes with the gateway in the network so that the data packets can be transmitted through the remaining network for it to implement the mesh topology. It allows the network to self-optimize by selecting the nest pathway to transmit the data between nodes.
"Difficult to Take Down the Whole Network: Since there is no primary component in the network and each node acts as the router, it is almost impossible to bring down the whole network. There is no central equipment, and it has several redundant connections. Therefore, making it difficult to take down the entire network. It is only possible when there is a global disaster if all the nodes are attacked."
"No Central Component is Required: The user does not need to include a central component to transmit or receive the data in the network. This is beneficial as the user does not have to invest in expensive central equipment. The network does not require additional room. Moreover, it provides an individual-based secure method of data transmission in the network. The user can also remain anonymous during transmission. Since there are the private connection between each node. It eliminated the requirement for additional firewalls and software that provide security in the network."
"Flexibility:In Mesh Topology, a partial shortfall option provides great flexibility. Therefore the user is not required to complete all the connections for each node in the network; that is, the user can implement partial mesh topology. The partial mesh topology saves the cost of cables and provides enhanced communication benefits."
Handle Large Volume of Data: Mesh topology can manage a large volume of data transmitted in the network. It is more efficient than all traditional systems as it can connect multiple nodes in the network. Multiple paths connecting different nodes in the network allow the user to transmit the data simultaneously between different nodes.
"There are several advantages of using mesh topology to establish a network, but there are limitations to using this topology. Some of the disadvantages of mesh topology are as follows:"
"High Cost to Set up:The cost of setting up Mesh topology is higher than alternative topologies because it requires cables and other equipment that are quite expensive. In order to implement the mesh topology in the network, it is necessary to ensure that there is suitable hardware, cabling, and network bandwidth, making it suitable for data transmission."
"Takes Time to Setup and Perform Maintenance: The user must establish multiple connections for each node in the network. Though adding new nodes in an already established network is simple, the initial step to set up a network is complex and expensive."
"High Possibility of Redundant Connections:Since multiple connections exist between each node of the network, there is a high possibility of unnecessary, redundant connections in the network. Some of these connections may not be used in the network until an existing connection fails."
"More Load on Each Node:There is no central equipment to manage the data transmission path within different nodes. The nodes are required to act as the router in the networks. The nodes must create their routing table, adding more responsibility to the node. It increases the complexity of the system."
Latency Issues:These issues are generally faced by low-power mesh topology. There is not enough processing power to handle the data simultaneously transmitted by the different nodes in the network promptly.
"Cloud networking refers to the practice of utilizing cloud computing technologies to provide networking services, such as data storage, computing power, and network connectivity."
Organizations can use virtualized infrastructure in cloud networking to create and manage their networks rather than relying on physical hardware. Cloud networking enables businesses to easily scale their network resources up or down as needed without having to invest in additional hardware.
"Some common cloud networking services include virtual private clouds (VPCs), which allow organizations to create their own private networks within a cloud environment, and software-defined wide area networks (SD-WANs), which can be used to manage network traffic across multiple locations. Cloud networking also enables remote access to network resources, allowing employees to access company data from anywhere with an internet connection securely."

"Overall, cloud networking provides businesses with greater flexibility, scalability, cost savings, security, and reliability, making it an attractive option for organizations of all sizes. By adapting cloud networking, organizations can better leverage technology to drive business success."
"Public cloud networking: Public cloud networking involves utilizing shared cloud infrastructure provided by third-party providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These providers offer a wide range of network services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), load balancing, and content delivery networks (CDNs), which can be accessed by businesses on a subscription basis."
Private cloud networking: A dedicated cloud environment for a particular enterprise is created via private cloud networking. Private cloud networking is flexible and may be tailored to an organization's particular requirements. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
Hybrid cloud networking: Using both public and private clouds simultaneously is known as hybrid cloud networking. This enables businesses to take advantage of the scalability and cost savings of public cloud networking while still maintaining control over sensitive data and applications through private cloud networking.
Multi-cloud networking: The multi-cloud networking involves using multiple cloud providers to host different applications or services. This can help businesses avoid vendor lock-in and take advantage of the unique features and services offered by different cloud providers.
"Edge cloud networking: Edge cloud networking involves deploying cloud infrastructure at the edge of the network, closer to end-users or devices. This can help reduce latency and improve performance for applications and services that require real-time processing or low-latency connectivity."
"The type of cloud networking that a business chooses to adopt will depend on its specific needs and requirements, as well as its budget and resources."
Cloud networking protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the transfer and management of data between cloud resources. These protocols are used to ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and securely within a cloud network environment. Some common cloud networking protocols include:
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP): TCP/IP is a set of protocols that define how data is transmitted between devices on the internet. It is the backbone of cloud networking and is used to transfer data between cloud resources.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data between web servers and web clients. Cloud networking commonly uses it to transfer data between cloud resources and web clients.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): SNMP is a protocol that is used to manage network devices and monitor network performance. It is commonly used in cloud networking to monitor the performance of cloud resources and identify potential issues.
Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS): SSL/TLS are protocols that are used to encrypt data transmitted over a network. They are commonly used in cloud networking to ensure that data is transmitted securely and to prevent unauthorized access to cloud resources.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP is a protocol that is used to exchange routing information between different networks. It is commonly used in cloud networking to manage data flow between different cloud resources and ensure that data is transmitted efficiently.
"In summary, cloud networking protocols play a critical role in ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently and securely within a cloud network environment. Understanding these protocols and how they are used can help ensure that cloud resources are effectively managed and optimized for performance."
Cloud networking tools are software applications and utilities that are used to manage and monitor cloud network resources. These tools are designed to simplify the management of cloud networking infrastructure and to help ensure that cloud resources are operating efficiently and securely. Some common cloud networking tools include:
Cloud Management Platforms (CMPs): CMPs are tools that are used to manage cloud resources across multiple cloud service providers. They provide a unified interface for managing cloud infrastructure and can help automate the deployment and management of cloud resources.
"Network Management Tools: Network management tools are used to monitor network performance and identify potential issues. They can help administrators identify network bottlenecks, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and optimize network performance."

"Cloud Monitoring Tools: Cloud monitoring tools are used to monitor the performance of cloud resources. They can help administrators identify performance bottlenecks, monitor resource utilization, and optimize cloud performance."
"In summary, cloud networking tools play a critical role in simplifying the management of cloud networking infrastructure and ensuring that cloud resources are operating efficiently and securely. Choosing the right cloud networking tools can help optimize cloud performance, improve network security, and streamline the management of cloud resources."
"Cloud networking architecture refers to the design, deployment, and management of network resources in a cloud computing environment. Cloud networking architecture includes various components such as virtual networks, gateways, load balancers, firewalls, and other network services required to support cloud services."
Here are some of the key components of cloud networking architecture:
"Virtual Networks: Virtual networks are a key component of cloud networking architecture. These networks are created using software-defined networking (SDN) technology, which allows network administrators to configure virtual networks and network resources from a central location. Virtual networks can be customized to meet the needs of specific cloud applications and can be scaled up or down as needed."
Gateways: Gateways are used to connect virtual networks to the public internet or to other networks. Gateways can be used to create secure connections between cloud resources and external networks and can provide a way to manage network traffic between different cloud environments.
Load Balancers: Load balancers are used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers or instances of an application. This helps ensure that cloud resources are utilized efficiently and can help prevent downtime or performance issues.
Firewalls: Firewalls are used to protect cloud resources from unauthorized access and to prevent network attacks. Cloud firewalls can be configured to monitor network traffic and to block traffic from known sources of malicious activity.
"Network Services: Network services such as domain name system (DNS) servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are also an important part of cloud networking architecture.

"In summary, cloud networking architecture is a critical component of a cloud computing environment. It provides the networking infrastructure required to support cloud services and helps ensure that cloud resources are optimized for performance, scalability, and security. By understanding the key components of cloud networking architecture, cloud administrators can effectively design and manage cloud networks to meet the needs of their organization."
"Switches and routers are the most widely used network hardware. However, we frequently hear individuals referring to hubs, repeaters, and bridges. Have you ever wondered why the former devices are chosen instead of the latter devices? One explanation might be that they are stronger and more effective. But what is the real cause of their effectiveness? In this context, concepts like ""Collision Domains"" and ""Broadcast Domains"" are relevant."
"Let's review that a hub is a multiple-port repeater before moving on. So that you may comprehend why repeaters and bridges aren't commonly used in production networks, consider how a switch functions as a multiple-port bridge (because of a smaller number of ports)."
"Collision Domain
When a device transmits a message to the network, all other devices that are a part of its collision domain must pay attention to it, regardless of whether it was intended for them or not. This situation is known as a collision domain. This is problematic because it will result in a collision if two devices send out their messages at the same time, forcing them to wait and send them again one at a time. It only occurs using a half-duplex mode, so keep that in mind."
"Broadcast Domain
When a device transmits a broadcast message, all other devices in that device's broadcast domain must pay attention to it. This situation is known as a broadcast domain. As a result, the network experiences significant LAN congestion, which reduces the available bandwidth for the users.
This leads us to the conclusion that the network is more effective at supplying better bandwidth to all of its users. There should be more collision domains and more broadcast domains."
"Which of our network devices are capable of violating collision domains, and which are capable of breaking broadcast domains? This question has to be answered now."
"Let's now focus on Hubs, Switches, and Routers and talk about them in relation to the domains listed above."
"Hub - We begin with a hub because it needs to be eliminated as soon as feasible. Because it doesn't separate a collision domain from a broadcast domain, or in other words, a hub is neither a collision domain separator nor a broadcast domain separator. All of the hub-connected devices are contained within a single collision and broadcast domain. Keep in mind that hubs only connect network segments, not segment a network."
"Switches - Compared to the hub, we have an advantage with switches. A switch is a collision domain separator because each port on it is in a different collision domain. As a result, messages sent by devices connected to separate ports never collide. This aids in network design, but switches continue to be a challenge. It is not a broadcast domain separator because they never break broadcast domains. There is still only one broadcast domain for the entire switch's ports. Even if a device sends a broadcast message, congestion will still occur."
Router - A router is a broadcast domain separator and a collision domain separator because it breaks both types of domains. A router can connect two networks. A broadcast message sent from one network to another will never be received because the router will never permit it to flow.
"Furthermore, the only way repeaters and bridges differ from hubs and switches is in the number of ports. In contrast to a repeater, a bridge simply breaks collision domains; but a repeater does not break either collision or broadcast domain."
"Since the Bellman-Ford algorithm is unable to prevent loops, the fundamental problem with Distance Vector Routing (DVR) protocols is Routing Loops. The Count to Infinity Problem is brought on by this routing loop in the DVR network. When two routers deliver updates simultaneously or when an interface goes down, routing loops frequently happen."
"Distance-vector routing has the drawback that while cost increases (bad news) propagate slowly, cost decreases (positive news) propagate quickly. Distance-vector routing takes some time for all other routers to become aware of a broken connection (cost becomes infinity), which is necessary for a routing protocol to function properly. Counting to infinity is the name given to the issue. A broken link's cost may not always be registered as infinite by all routers until numerous updates have passed."
The two-node loop issue is an example of count to infinity. Let's examine the case shown in Figure to better grasp the issue.
"A system with three nodes is depicted in the figure. Only the elements of the forwarding table required for our discussion have been displayed. Nodes A and B are first able to connect to node X. However, the connection between A and X abruptly breaks down. The table of Node A is altered. Everything will be good if A can quickly transmit its table to B. If B, instead of waiting for A to transmit its forwarding table, sends its forwarding table to A first, the system becomes unstable."
"When Node A receives the update, it instantly updates its forwarding table in the event that B has managed to connect to X. A has just updated B and sent it a fresh message. B has now updated its forwarding table as it believes that something has changed around A. Until it approaches infinity, the price of getting to X rises gradually. Both A and B are aware that X cannot be reached at this time. In contrast, the system is unstable at the present time."
"Node A believes that node B is the path to X, while node B believes that node A is the way to X. When A gets a packet intended for X, the packet first travels to B before returning to A. Similar to this, if B receives a packet meant for X, it travels to A before returning to B. A two-node loop problem is caused by packets bouncing between A and B. There are a few remedies that have been suggested for this form of instability."
The following is the answer to the problem of counting to infinity:
"Split Horizon
The split horizon is a method for resolving instability. Each node in this technique delivers a portion of its table across each interface rather than flooding the table through all of them. If node B believes that the best way to go to X is through node A, then node B need not inform node A of this information because it has already been provided by node A (A already knows).
Confusion is brought on by receiving data from node A, altering it, then sending it back to node A. In our example, node B trims the end of its forwarding table before transmitting it to node A. In this instance, node A maintains a distance to X of infinity. Later, node B similarly makes corrections to its forwarding table when node A transmits it to it. After the initial update, the system is stable because both nodes A and B are aware that X cannot be reached."
"Poison Reverse
The split-horizon approach has one disadvantage. If there is no news about a route after a certain amount of time, the corresponding protocol typically employs a timer and instructs the node to remove the route from its table. In the previous example, node A is unable to determine whether node B's decision to remove the route to X from its advertisement to node A is the result of the split-horizon technique (the information came from A) or the fact that B has not recently received any news concerning X.
In the poison reverse technique, B can still state the value for X, but if the information came from A, it can substitute infinite for the distance as a warning: "" Do not utilise this value; you are the source of my knowledge regarding this route."""
"It is an example of the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol. In this protocol, the sender node continuously transmits a defined number of data frames in the network. The window size determines the number of nodes. The sender can transmit these frames without receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver node. This is a special case of sliding window protocol where the sender window size is N, and the receiver window size is 1."
"The receiver node keeps track of the sequence number of the next frame to be received by the receiver node. The receiver discards any data frame with a different sequence number. This means that it deletes any duplicate frame already acknowledged by the receiver or any frame out of order that is expected to receive later by the node. It only accepts in-order delivery of nodes. It then transmits an acknowledgment for the last data frame that was transmitted in the correct order. Once the sender node transmits all the data frames in the window, it searches for all the frames since the first data frame was lost during transmission. The sender node then goes to the sequence number of the last frame acknowledged by the receiver, and it then fills the window beginning with this frame and continues the transmission process."
This protocol is also known as Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request. This protocol is implemented in the data link layer of the node in the network. This protocol uses a sliding window method that ensures reliable delivery of data frames from the sender node to the receiver node. The good data frames are received and buffered by the receiver node. This protocol is more efficient as it only retransmits the corrupted data frames during transmission in the network.
"In order to implement Selective Repeat Protocol requires, two windows of the same size. The sending window stores the data frames to be transmitted by the sender node. At the same time, the receiving window is responsible for storing the data frames received by the receiving node."
"The window size is kept at half of the maximum sequence number of the data frame. For example, if the sequence number ranges from 0-15, the window size for both the sender and receiver node will be 8."
"Go-Back-N ARQ provides for sending multiple frames before receiving the acknowledgment for the first frame. The frames are sequentially numbered and have a finite number of frames. The maximum number of frames that can be sent depends upon the size of the sending window. If the acknowledgment of a frame is not received within an agreed-upon time, all frames starting from that frame are retransmitted."
"The size of the sending window determines the sequence number of the outbound frames. If the sequence number of the frames is an n-bit field, then the range of sequence numbers that can be assigned is 0 to 2n?1. Consequently, the size of the sending window is 2n?1. Thus to accommodate a sending window size of 2n?1, an n-bit sequence number is chosen."
It enables the sender node to transmit multiple data frames in the network. The data frames transmitted depend upon the availability of data frames in the sending window. The next frame can be transmitted in the network without waiting for the acknowledgment of the previous data frame. The size of the sender window determines the number of frames that can be transmitted simultaneously.
The receiver node stores the sequence number of the first incorrect or corrupted frame or the node not received by the receiver node. The receiver node then fills the receiving window with upcoming frames received by the node once the current window is filled. Then the receiver nodes transmit the sequence number of the corrupt or missing frame with the acknowledgment frame.
"The sender node continuously transmits the available frame in the sender window. Once all the data frames stored in the sender window are transmitted to the receiver node, it re-sends the data frames whose sequence numbers are provided by the acknowledgment. Once the re-transmission is completed, it continues transmitting to the other network nodes."
The two sliding window protocol also differs in their function and working. The difference between Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat protocols are as follows:
The selective Repeat protocol is the more efficient as it does not waste network resources on the data frames that the sender correctly transmits to the receiver node.
"The Go Back N protocol is more used because it is less complex to implement in the network. Moreover, it is comparatively less expensive as it requires less storage."
"If the window size is equal for both Go-Back-N and selective repeat protocol, then the efficiency of both these protocols is almost equal. The resources' usage and availability determine that either protocol will be implemented."
Selective Repeat Protocol has the advantages of both Stop and Wait and Go Back N protocol.
"The handling of data flow between different nodes, such as computers, printers, and wireless devices, is referred to as flow control in the network. It is an essential mechanism for effectively transmitting data in the network. Data flow is a serious concern when transmitting data from one node to another. It is caused when the receiving node is unable to handle the data. The data transmitted is more than the receiving node can manage. This leads to data loss and re-transmission of the =data frames."
"In order to prevent data loss and effectively transmit data in the network, flow control instructs the sending node about how much data should be retransmitted to the receiving node. The node transmitting the data should wait for an acknowledgment from the receiving node before sending additional data frames into the network."
"The flow control protocols that determine the mechanism used to send acknowledgment and retransmit data are Stop and Wait, GoBackN, and Selective Repeat."
This is the most simple protocol that ensures guaranteed transmission of the data in the network.
Here the stop and wait refer to the two steps performed by the protocols. The sender node transmits the data into the network. The data frame is sent sequentially in one by one manner. Once a data frame is transmitted in the network. The sending node waits for the receiving node to send an acknowledgment in the network.
The stop and wait protocol is implemented as a flow control mechanism when the data link layer in the network provides the flow control services. This data link protocol enables the sender to transmit the data over noiseless channels.
"This protocol supports unidirectional data transmission in the network. This means that there is only one sender or receiver in the network. Both nodes cannot simultaneously send or receive the data in the network. The nodes cannot utilize the resources of the network. The protocol ensures that the data flow is maintained in the network, but it lacks any error control mechanism to the network."
"The primary concept behind implementing this protocol is that whenever the sender node transmits a data frame in the network, it waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver. Only when the acknowledgment is received it transmit to the other node in the network. The transmission is halted if the acknowledgment is received."
"The idea behind using this frame is that when the sender sends the frame, he waits for the acknowledgment before sending the next frame."
"Before discussing GoBackN and Selective Repeat protocols, the user must have prior knowledge of another important protocol: the sliding window protocol."
The Sliding Window Protocol is a mechanism that allows the data-transmitting node to transmit multiple data frames simultaneously in the network. This protocol manages the data packets shared between two nodes where reliable and guaranteed data frame delivery is required. This protocol is implemented in the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
"In this protocol, each data frame is assigned a sequence number. This protocol is implemented to ensure that the successfully transmitted data is not transmitted again by the sender node. This is useful as it increases the efficiency of the network and avoids duplicate data. The sequence number is unique for each data frame and used to confirm whether the receiving node successfully receives the data frame."
Two types of Sliding Window Protocols can be implemented in the network:
"In Go-Back-N ARQ, N stands for the Window size of the sender node, and ARQ stands for Automatic Repeat Request. Let us consider an example to explain this protocol where the sender window size is 3. this means that the sender node can transmit three data frames before waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiving node."
"The nodes use protocol pipelining that allows the nodes to transmit multiple data frames in the network simultaneously without waiting for the acknowledgment of the first frame. Suppose the sender needs to send 5 data frames in the network. If the protocol Go-Back-3 is implemented, the user can send frame 1, frame 2, and frame 3 simultaneously without waiting for the acknowledgment of frame 1."
"Since multiple data frames are transmitted in this protocol, each data frame sent is numbered sequentially. This step is performed to ensure that each data frame can be differentiated. These numbers are referred to as sequential numbers."
The number of frames that can be sent simultaneously may differ with the sending node. The sender window size determines it. We can say that N data frames can be sent simultaneously in the network before the sender node receives the acknowledgment for the first frame sent to the receiver.
"If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment from the receiver node within an agreed-upon time, then all the data frames transmitted and stored in the current window are retransmitted by the sender. Suppose the sender has transmitted frame 1, frame 2, and frame 3 and does not receive the acknowledgment for frame 1; then all three frames will be retransmitted."
Selective Repeat ARQ is also called the Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request. This protocol is implemented in the data link layer of the OSI model. This protocol implements a sliding window method to transmit the data frames in the network.
"If there are limited mistakes during the data frame transmission, then the user can implement Go-Back-N ARQ, but if there are a lot of errors, then implementing Selective Repeat ARQ is the best option. It works well in a limited bandwidth."
The window size for both the sender and receiver nodes is kept equal. This is done by making the window size for the sender node equal to the receiver node window. The sliding window is always more than 1.
"Suppose a corrupt frame is transmitted in the network. When this corrupt data frame reaches the receiver node, it is not directly rejected by the receiver; instead, the receiving node transmits a negative acknowledgment to the sender. Upon receiving the negative acknowledgment, the sender resends the data frame instantly. There is no waiting for any time out to transmit that data frame."
These two protocols act as a flow control mechanism and can be implemented in the network that ensures that the data is successfully transmitted from the sender node to receiving node since Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat protocols are sliding window protocols.
Let us discuss the difference between Stop and Wait Protocol and Sliding Window Protocol.
The two sliding window protocol also differs in their function and working. The difference between Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat protocols are as follows:
"The following table differentiates between all three flow control protocols that are Stop and Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat protocols:"
Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat both use Sliding Window Protocol that enables the sender node to transmit multiple data frames simultaneously in the network. The sender node does not require waiting for the acknowledgment from the receiver node to send several data frames.
"The Stop-and-Wait protocol is different from the sliding window protocol as this protocol cannot transmit multiple data frames simultaneously in the network. It only allows the sender to node sends one data frame at a time. The sender waits for an acknowledgment after transmitting each data frame in the network. If it does not receive the data frame in a given time, it then retransmits the frame."
"Network functions virtualization (NFV) is an approach to network architecture that involves replacing dedicated network hardware devices with software-based virtualized network functions (VNFs) that run on standard servers, storage, and switches."
"In traditional networking, specialized hardware devices such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers are used to perform specific network functions. With NFV, these functions are virtualized and can be run as software on commodity hardware, leading to greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness."
"NFV enables network operators to quickly and easily deploy and scale network functions as needed, without the need for physical hardware installation or maintenance. By virtualizing network functions, operators can also reduce their capital and operational expenditures, and increase their network agility, flexibility, and scalability."
"NFV is often used in conjunction with software-defined networking (SDN), another approach to network architecture that separates the control plane and data plane of the network, allowing for centralized network management and orchestration. Together, NFV and SDN enable network operators to build more agile and efficient networks that can adapt to changing business and user requirements."
"The concept of network functions virtualization (NFV) emerged in 2012, when a group of leading telecommunications service providers, including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, and NTT Docomo, formed the NFV Industry Specification Group (ISG) under the auspices of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)."
"The goal of the NFV ISG was to develop a framework for virtualizing network functions and deploying them on industry-standard servers, storage, and switches, with the aim of improving network agility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. The NFV ISG released its first set of specifications in 2013, defining the requirements and architecture for virtualized network functions."
"Since then, NFV has gained widespread adoption across the telecommunications industry, with many service providers and vendors developing and deploying NFV solutions. In 2015, the ETSI released a second set of NFV specifications, expanding on the original framework and addressing topics such as security, management and orchestration, and network slicing."
"Today, NFV is considered a key enabler of the emerging 5G network architecture, providing a flexible and efficient way to deploy and manage the wide range of network functions and services needed to support the diverse use cases and applications of 5G."
"In addition to the ETSI NFV ISG, other industry groups and organizations have developed standards and best practices for NFV, including the Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP), the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV), and the Linux Foundation Networking (LFN) project, among others."
"Network functions virtualization (NFV) works by virtualizing network functions that were traditionally performed by specialized hardware devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers. These network functions are abstracted from their underlying hardware and implemented as software-based virtual network functions (VNFs) that run on standard servers, storage, and switches."
"NFV is typically implemented using a virtualization layer that allows multiple VNFs to run on the same physical infrastructure. This virtualization layer provides isolation between the VNFs, enabling them to run independently of each other, and also provides resource management and allocation, ensuring that each VNF gets the resources it needs to operate effectively."
"Virtualization layer: This layer provides the virtualization environment that enables multiple VNFs to run on the same physical infrastructure. It includes a hypervisor or container-based virtualization platform that provides isolation, resource allocation, and management for the VNFs."
"Virtual network functions (VNFs): These are the software-based network functions that perform specific network tasks, such as routing, switching, firewalling, load balancing, and encryption. The VNFs are typically deployed as virtual machines or containers and run on the virtualization layer."
"NFV infrastructure (NFVI): This is the physical infrastructure that provides the computing, storage, and networking resources needed to support the VNFs. The NFVI can be located in the data centre, at the network edge, or in the cloud."
"Management and orchestration (MANO): This component provides the management and orchestration functions needed to deploy, monitor, and manage the VNFs running on the NFVI. It includes functions such as service orchestration, resource allocation, fault management, and performance management."
"Overall, NFV enables organizations to deploy network functions more quickly and cost-effectively while also providing greater flexibility, scalability, and agility. By virtualizing network functions, operators can create a more dynamic and efficient network architecture that can adapt to changing business and user requirements."
There are several benefits to using Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in modern network architectures. Here are a few key reasons why organizations may choose to adopt NFV:
"Cost savings: NFV can help organizations reduce costs by replacing dedicated hardware devices with software-based virtualized network functions running on commodity hardware. This can help to reduce capital expenditures and operational costs associated with purchasing, deploying, and maintaining specialized hardware."
"Agility and flexibility: NFV enables network operators to quickly and easily deploy and scale network functions as needed, without the need for physical hardware installation or maintenance. This can help to reduce the time to market for new services and applications, and improve the agility and flexibility of the network."
"Scalability: NFV can help to improve network scalability by enabling organizations to scale up or down the capacity of virtualized network functions as needed, based on changing traffic patterns and demand."
"Enhanced network security: NFV can help to improve network security by enabling the deployment of virtualized network functions that can detect and mitigate security threats, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption services."
Service innovation: NFV can enable organizations to innovate and introduce new network services and applications more quickly and easily since the virtualized network functions can be easily deployed and scaled as needed.
"Overall, NFV provides a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective approach to network architecture, allowing organizations to build more agile, efficient, and innovative networks that can adapt to changing business and user requirements."
"While there are many benefits to network functions virtualization (NFV), organizations should consider some risks and challenges before implementing NFV. Here are a few potential risks of NFV:"
"Complexity: NFV can add complexity to network architecture, as it involves deploying and managing multiple virtualized network functions on a shared physical infrastructure. This can make troubleshooting issues more challenging and ensure overall network performance."
"Security: NFV introduces new security risks, as virtualized network functions may be vulnerable to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the virtualization software or the underlying hardware infrastructure. Proper security measures must be put in place to mitigate these risks."
Integration with legacy systems: Integrating NFV with existing legacy systems and network architectures can be challenging and may require additional investment in new hardware and software to enable compatibility.
Performance and reliability: The performance and reliability of NFV may be impacted by the virtualization layer and the underlying hardware infrastructure. Organizations must ensure that they have the right resources in place to support the VNFs and to deliver the desired performance and reliability.
"Vendor lock-in: Organizations that adopt NFV may become locked into a particular vendor or technology, which can limit their flexibility and ability to switch vendors or technologies in the future."
"Overall, while NFV can offer significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility, and flexibility, organizations should carefully consider the potential risks and challenges before implementing this technology in their networks. They should also ensure that they have the right expertise, tools, and processes in place to successfully deploy, manage, and secure their NFV environments."
"This article begins with a consideration of security at the network layer. Security is implemented between two hosts, two routers, or a host and a router at the network layer."
"Those programs directly using the network layer's services, including routing protocols, are protected by network-layer security. Since UDP is a connectionless protocol and transport-layer security mechanisms cannot be applied to UDP, apps that use UDP can also profit from this service. We just talk about IPSec as an example of application-layer security here. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a group of protocols known as IP Security (IPSec) to secure a packet at the network level. The IP layer benefits from creating authenticated and private packets thanks to IPSec."
Transport mode or tunnel mode are the two ways IPSec can be used.
"Transport Mode - In transport mode, IPSec safeguards information sent from the transport layer to the network layer. Or, to put it another way, transport mode safeguards the payload that will be contained in the network layer, as shown in Figure."
"Keep in mind that IP header protection is not provided by transport mode. To put it another way, the packet from the transport layer is protected by transport mode, which does not secure the entire IP packet (the IP-layer payload). The information arriving from the transport layer is enhanced in this mode by adding the IPSec header (and trailer). The IP header is included afterwards."
"When host-to-host (end-to-end) data protection is required, we typically employ the transport mode. The payload sent from the transport layer is authenticated and/or encrypted by the sender host using IPSec. The IP packet is delivered to the transport layer by the receiving host using IPSec to verify the authentication and/or decrypt it. This idea is demonstrated in the given figure."
"Tunnel Mode - IPSec safeguards the entire IP packet when it is employed in tunnel mode. As shown in Figure, it starts with an IP packet that includes the header, uses IPSec security techniques to encrypt the entire packet, and then inserts a new IP header."
"We'll see in a moment how the new IP header differs from the old IP header in terms of its information. As illustrated in the following figure, tunnel mode is typically used between two routers, a host and a router, or a router and a host. It appears as though the complete original packet travels via a fictitious tunnel to prevent tampering between the sender and the receiver."
"The IPSec layer sits between the transport and network layers in transport mode. In tunnel mode, data is transferred back and forth between the network and IPSec layers before being sent back to the network layer. The two modes are compared in the following figure."
"To authenticate and/ or encrypt packets at the IP level, IPSec defines two protocols the Authentication Header (AH) Protocol and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) Protocol."
"The Authentication Header (AH) protocol is intended to verify the legitimacy of the originating host and protect the data integrity of the IP packet's content. A message digest is generated by the protocol using a hash function and a symmetric (secret) key, and it is added to the authentication header (see MAC). In accordance with the mode (transport or tunnel), the AH is subsequently placed in the proper location. The authentication header's fields and location in transport mode are shown in the image below."
"When an IP datagram contains an authentication header, the protocol field of the IP header's original value is changed to the value 51. The initial value of the protocol field (the kind of payload that the IP datagram is carrying) is stored in the following header field, which is inside the authentication header. The steps that come after adding an authentication header are as follows:"
"The authentication data field in the authentication header, which is added to the payload, is set to 0."
"To make the total length suitable for a specific hashing technique, padding may be applied."
"The entire packet is used for hashing. However, only those IP header values that remain constant throughout transmission are taken into account when calculating the message digest (authentication data)."
The protocol field's value is changed to 51 before the IP header is appended.
"Next Header - The type of payload that an IP datagram carries is specified by its 8-bit next header field (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, or OSPF)."
"Payload Length - The 8-bit field has an inaccurate name. It does not specify the size of the payload; however, it does provide the authentication header's size in 4-byte increments, excluding the first 8 bytes."
Security Parameter Indexes - A link known as a Security Association uses a 32-bit field called the security parameter index (SPI) that serves as a virtual circuit identity for all packets delivered.
"Sequence Number - An ordered sequence of datagrams is provided by a 32-bit sequence number. A playback is prevented by the sequence numbers. In spite of packet retransmission, it should be noted that the sequence number is not repeated. After reaching 232, a sequence number does not continue; instead, a new connection is required."
"Authentication Data - Last but not least, the IP datagram as a whole?aside from the fields that are modified during transit?is hashed to provide the authentication data field (e.g., time-to-live)."
"The AH protocol provides only source authentication and data integrity; secrecy is not one of them. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), a substitute protocol later described by IPSec, offers source authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. The ESP appends a header and trailer. The authentication data for ESP are inserted at the end of the packet, which simplifies the calculation. The placement of the ESP header and trailer is illustrated in the following figure."
The protocol field in the IP header has a value of 50 when an ESP header and trailer are present. The initial value of the protocol field (the TCP or UDP payload format that the IP datagram is using as its payload type) is stored in a field inside the ESP trailer called the next-header field. Following are the steps of the ESP procedure:
Encryption is used for both the payload and the trailer.
"The authentication data is created using the ESP header, payload, and trailer."
The authentication information is included in the ESP trailer's conclusion.
"The protocol value is changed to 50, and the IP header is added."
There are the following fields for the header and trailer:
Security Parameter Index - The index field for the 32-bit security parameter is comparable to the one specified for the AH protocol.
Sequence Number - The 32-bit sequence number field is comparable to the one specified for the AH protocol.
Padding - This padding field has a configurable length (0 to 255 bytes) and contains only zeros.
"Pad Length- The number of padding bytes is specified by an 8-bit parameter called pad length. The range of the value is 0 to 255, with 255 being the rare figure."
Next Header - The 8-bit next-header field is comparable to that specified in the AH protocol. It fulfils the same function as the IP header's pre-encapsulation protocol field.
"Authentication Data - After applying an authentication technique to specific portions of the datagram, the authentication data field is the end result. Take note of how the authentication information in AH and ESP differs. In AH, a portion of the IP header is taken into account while calculating the authentication data; this is not the case in ESP."
"The ESP protocol was created after the AH protocol had already been implemented. With added capabilities, ESP performs the same tasks as AH (confidentiality). In reality, we do not require AH. AH will, however, continue to exist on the Internet until these items are phased out because the implementation of AH is currently present in some commercial products."
"For packets at the network layer, the two protocols AH and ESP can offer a number of security features. Lists of services that are offered for each protocol are shown in the table below:"
"Access Control - IPSec uses a Security Association Database (SAD) to offer access control in an indirect manner. A packet is rejected when it reaches its destination, and no Security Association has been created for it yet."
Data Integrity -AH and ESP both maintain the integrity of the message. The sender creates and sends a data digest for the recipient to review.
"Entity Authentication - The sender of the data is authenticated in both AH and ESP by the Security Association, and the sender transmits the keyed-hash digest of the data."
"Confidentiality - The message's confidentiality is provided via ESP's encryption. Though, confidentiality is not offered by AH. If confidentiality is required, ESP ought to be used rather than AH."
"Replay Attack Protection - Both protocols employ a sliding receiver window and sequence numbers to protect against the replay attack. When the Security Association is established, a distinct sequence number is present in each IPSec header. Starting at zero, the number grows until it reaches 232 - 1. The previous Security Association is removed, and a new one is created at the same time as the sequence number is reset to zero when it reaches its maximum value. IPSec requires the usage of a fixed-size window at the receiver to avoid processing duplicate packets. The receiver chooses the window's size, which has a default value of 64."
"Data is transmitted in discrete units called packets through computer networks. Each packet is transmitted separately and could take a different path to get there. The original message is recreated once every one of these packets has arrived at its destination. However, it is possible that the message won't reach its target occasionally if the website is down, there is network congestion, or there is some other technical issue. Ping and Traceroute, two widely used applications, are used to diagnose such traffic jams and network problems."
"It is a tool that assists in determining whether a specific IP address is reachable or not. Sending a packet to the designated address and then waiting for a response is how Ping operates. Furthermore, it computes the round-trip time and reports inaccuracies."
"Ping can also be used to see if any of the devices connected to a local network are running. To check if the address is active, execute ping 127.0.0.1 at the command prompt. If it is, the ping will return a message similar to this:"
"Even if the sender is not online, the local host with the IP address 127.0.0.1 would still receive a ping response."
"It is a tool that tracks a packet from your computer to the host and displays the number of steps (hops) that were necessary to get there, along with the duration of each step."
"In order for Traceroute to function, data packets must have a short survival time (Time to Live, or TTL), which indicates how many steps (hops) the packet can survive before being returned. A node returns the packet and gives its own identity when a packet can't make it to its intended destination and expires in the middle of the process."
"Traceroute may therefore recognize the intermediate hosts by gradually increasing the TTL. Network congestion is the cause of slow-loading Web sites and failed connections and is indicated if any of the hops return with the message ""Request timed out."""
"The primary distinction between Ping and Traceroute is that Ping is a quick and simple tool that determines whether or not a particular server is reachable and how long it will take to send and receive data from the server. In contrast, traceroute determines the exact route travelled to reach the server and the time required by each step (hop)."
"In computer network management, a ping (also known as packet internet or inter-network groper) is a straightforward Internet tool that enables a user to test and confirm whether a certain target IP address exists and can accept requests."
"In order to determine whether the host system a user is seeking to connect to is active, Ping is also employed for diagnostic purposes."
"An ICMP Echo Request is sent to a pre-specified network interface by Ping, which then waits for a response."
"Using the tool Traceroute, you can see how many steps (hops) it took a packet to go from your computer to the host, as well as the amount of time needed for each step."
"Data packets with a brief life duration (Time to Live, or TTL) are transmitted by Traceroute; this parameter determines how many steps (hops) the packet can endure before being returned."
"While a traceroute is a platform-specific function, the ping is a command-line tool that is accessible on all systems."
"Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that separates the network's control and data planes. The traditional networking architecture has a tightly coupled relationship between the data and control planes. This means that network devices, such as routers and switches, are responsible for forwarding packets and determining how the network should operate."
"With SDN, the control plane is decoupled from the data plane and implemented in software, allowing for centralized network control. The control plane, also called the network controller, is responsible for making decisions about how traffic should be forwarded, based on the overall network policy. The data plane, on the other hand, is responsible for forwarding traffic based on the decisions made by the control plane."
"In SDN, network devices are called switches, and they are typically simple, low-cost devices that forward traffic based on the instructions received from the network controller. The controller communicates with the switches using a standard protocol, such as OpenFlow, which allows the controller to program the switches to forward traffic in a particular way."
"In computer networking, the data plane is the part of a network device responsible for forwarding data packets from one interface to another. It is also referred to as the forwarding plane or the user plane."
"The data plane operates at the lowest level of the network stack, typically at Layer 2 (the Data Link layer) and Layer 3 (the Network layer) of the OSI model. Its main responsibility is to forward packets from one interface to another based on the destination address contained in the packet header."
"In traditional networking, network devices such as routers and switches have a tightly coupled control plane and data plane. This means that the devices are responsible for both forwarding packets and making decisions about how the network should operate. However, in software-defined networking (SDN), the control plane is separated from the data plane, allowing for centralized control of the network."
"In SDN, the data plane is implemented in network devices, such as switches, and is responsible for forwarding packets based on the instructions received from the centralized control plane. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the network, as the data plane can be reprogrammed in real-time to accommodate changing network conditions."
"In computer networking, the control plane is part of a network device or system that is responsible for managing and controlling the flow of network traffic. It is responsible for making decisions about how packets are forwarded across the network based on factors such as network topology, routing protocols, and network policies."
"The control plane operates at a higher network stack level than the data plane, typically at Layer 3 (the Network layer) and above in the OSI model. It is responsible for routing, switching, and traffic engineering tasks."
"In traditional networking, the control plane and data plane are tightly coupled, meaning that network devices such as routers and switches are responsible for forwarding packets and making decisions about how the network should operate. However, in software-defined networking (SDN), the control plane is separated from the data plane, allowing for centralized network control."
"In SDN, the controller communicates with the network devices in the data plane using a standard protocol, such as OpenFlow, to program the devices to forward packets in a particular way."
"The benefits of a separate control plane in SDN include greater network flexibility and scalability, as the network policy can be changed in real-time to meet changing network conditions. It also allows for easier network management, as the network can be managed from a centralized location."
"The architecture of software-defined networking (SDN) consists of three main layers: the application layer, the control layer, and the infrastructure layer. Each layer has a specific role and interacts with the other layers to manage and control the network."
"Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer is the bottom layer of the SDN architecture, also known as the data plane. It consists of physical and virtual network devices such as switches, routers, and firewalls that are responsible for forwarding network traffic based on the instructions received from the control plane."
"Control Layer: The control layer is the middle layer of the SDN architecture, also known as the control plane. It consists of a centralized controller that communicates with the infrastructure layer devices and is responsible for managing and configuring the network.
The controller interacts with the devices in the infrastructure layer using protocols such as OpenFlow to program the forwarding behaviour of the switches and routers. The controller uses network policies and rules to make decisions about how traffic should be forwarded based on factors such as network topology, traffic patterns, and quality of service requirements."
Application Layer: The application layer is the top layer of the SDN architecture and is responsible for providing network services and applications to end-users. This layer consists of various network applications that interact with the control layer to manage the network.
"Examples of applications that can be deployed in an SDN environment include network virtualization, traffic engineering, security, and monitoring. The application layer can be used to create customized network services that meet specific business needs."
"The main benefit of the SDN architecture is its flexibility and ability to centralize control of the network. The separation of the control plane from the data plane enables network administrators to configure and manage the network more easily and in a more granular way, allowing for greater network agility and faster response times to changes in network traffic."
"Software-defined networking (SDN) offers several advantages over traditional networking architectures, including:"
"Centralized Network Control: One of the key benefits of SDN is that it centralizes the control of the network in a single controller, making it easier to manage and configure the network. This allows network administrators to define and enforce network policies in a more granular way, resulting in better network security, performance, and reliability."
"Programmable Network: In an SDN environment, network devices are programmable and can be reconfigured on the fly to meet changing network requirements. This allows network administrators to quickly adapt the network to changing traffic patterns and demands, resulting in better network performance and efficiency."
"Cost Savings: With SDN, network administrators can use commodity hardware to build a network, reducing the cost of proprietary network hardware. Additionally, the centralization of network control can reduce the need for manual network management, leading to cost savings in labor and maintenance."
Enhanced Network Security: The centralized control of the network in SDN makes it easier to detect and respond to security threats. The use of network policies and rules allows administrators to implement fine-grained security controls that can mitigate security risks.
"Scalability: SDN makes it easier to scale the network to meet changing traffic demands. With the ability to programmatically control the network, administrators can quickly adjust the network to handle more traffic without the need for manual intervention."
"Simplified Network Management: SDN can simplify network management by abstracting the underlying network hardware and presenting a logical view of the network to administrators. This makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot the network, resulting in better network uptime and reliability."
"Overall, SDN offers a more flexible, programmable, and centralized approach to networking that can result in significant cost savings, enhanced network security, and improved network performance and reliability."
"While software-defined networking (SDN) has several advantages over traditional networking, there are also some potential disadvantages that organizations should be aware of. Here are some of the main disadvantages of SDN:"
"Complexity: SDN can be more complex than traditional networking because it involves a more sophisticated set of technologies and requires specialized skills to manage. For example, the use of a centralized controller to manage the network requires a deep understanding of the SDN architecture and protocols."
"Dependency on the Controller: The centralized controller is a critical component of SDN, and if it fails, the entire network could go down. This means that organizations need to ensure that the controller is highly available and that they have a robust backup and disaster recovery plan in place."
"Compatibility: Some legacy network devices may not be compatible with SDN, which means that organizations may need to replace or upgrade these devices to take full advantage of the benefits of SDN."
"Security: While SDN can enhance network security, it can also introduce new security risks. For example, a single point of control could be an attractive target for attackers, and the programmability of the network could make it easier for attackers to manipulate traffic."
"Vendor Lock-In: SDN solutions from different vendors may not be interoperable, which could lead to vendor lock-in. This means that organizations may be limited in their ability to switch to another vendor or integrate new solutions into their existing network."
"Performance: The centralized control of the network in SDN can introduce latency, which could impact network performance in certain situations. Additionally, the overhead of the SDN controller could impact the performance of the network as the network scales."
"In summary, while SDN offers many benefits, organizations should carefully consider the potential drawbacks before implementing an SDN solution. A thorough evaluation of the organization's needs and existing infrastructure, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and limitations of SDN, is critical to making an informed decision."
"Overall, SDN is an emerging technology that has the potential to transform the way networks are designed, deployed, and managed."
"Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that separates the network's control and data planes. The traditional networking architecture has a tightly coupled relationship between the data and control planes. This means that network devices, such as routers and switches, are responsible for forwarding packets and determining how the network should operate."
"With SDN, the control plane is decoupled from the data plane and implemented in software, allowing for centralized network control. The control plane, also called the network controller, is responsible for making decisions about how traffic should be forwarded, based on the overall network policy. The data plane, on the other hand, is responsible for forwarding traffic based on the decisions made by the control plane."
"In SDN, network devices are called switches, and they are typically simple, low-cost devices that forward traffic based on the instructions received from the network controller. The controller communicates with the switches using a standard protocol, such as OpenFlow, which allows the controller to program the switches to forward traffic in a particular way."
"Network functions virtualization (NFV) is an approach to network architecture that involves replacing dedicated network hardware devices with software-based virtualized network functions (VNFs) that run on standard servers, storage, and switches."
"In traditional networking, specialized hardware devices such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers are used to perform specific network functions. With NFV, these functions are virtualized and can be run as software on commodity hardware, leading to greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness."
"NFV enables network operators to quickly and easily deploy and scale network functions as needed without the need for physical hardware installation or maintenance. By virtualizing network functions, operators can also reduce their capital and operational expenditures and increase their network agility, flexibility, and scalability."
"NFV is often used in conjunction with software-defined networking (SDN), another approach to network architecture that separates the control plane and data plane of the network, allowing for centralized network management and orchestration. Together, NFV and SDN enable network operators to build more agile and efficient networks that can adapt to changing business and user requirements."
"Software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are both technologies that aim to improve network agility, flexibility, and efficiency. While there is some overlap between these two concepts, there are also some important differences. Here are some key differences between SDN and NFV:"
"Overall, while there is some overlap between SDN and NFV, these technologies have different goals and approaches. SDN is primarily focused on traffic flow management and control, while NFV is focused on virtualizing network functions to enable more flexible and efficient network architectures. Both technologies can be used together to create highly dynamic and programmable networks that can adapt to changing business and user requirements."
"SDN and NFV are complementary technologies that can be used together to create more flexible, scalable, and efficient network architectures. While there are some differences between these technologies, they both share a common goal of enabling more agile and adaptable networks that can support the evolving needs of modern businesses and users."
"Virtual Circuits are computer networks that offer connection-oriented services, whereas Datagram networks offer connection-less services. The Internet that we use is actually built on a Datagram network (connection-less) at the network level since not all packets that travel from a source to a destination use the same route."
"Connection-oriented switching is another name for virtual circuits. Before messages are sent, a virtual circuit switching sets a predetermined routing. This route is referred to as a virtual circuit since it gives the user the impression that a passionate physical circuit exists. The call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection between the sender and the recipient."
"The term ""virtual circuit"" refers to a logical link between two network nodes, typically in a communications network. The path consists of many network parts that are connected by switches."
"To better comprehend the virtual circuits, let's look at the diagram shown below:"
"The transmitter and receiver in the aforementioned diagram are A and B. The sender and receiver are linked together using the call request and call accept packets. Once a path has been established, data will be transferred."
"The receiver transmits an acknowledgementsignal after receiving the data to confirm receipt of the message. If a user wants to break the connection, a clear signal is sent."
"It is a method of switching packets in which every packet, or ""datagram,"" is seen as a distinct entity. The switch uses the destination information contained in each packet to direct it to the intended location. Since no specific channel is classified for a connection session, there is no need to reserve resources. As a result, packets have a header with all of the information about the destination. A packet's header is examined by the intermediate nodes, which then select an appropriate link to another node that is closer to the destination."
"Datagram networks assign resources according to the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) principle. Regardless of its source or destination, if another packet is being processed when a packet arrives at a router, it must wait."
"Datagram packets transmitted between hosts H1 and H2 are shown in the diagram above. The same message is being carried by the four datagram packets bearing the labels A, B, C, and D, each of which is being sent by a separate path. The packets of the message reach their destination out of order. It is H2's responsibility to rearrange the packets in order to recover the original message."
Let's look at the key distinctions between these two highly contested topics now:
"Connection-oriented switching is another name for virtual circuits. Prior to message transmission, virtual circuit switching creates a predetermined path."
"Since it seems to the user to be a devoted physical circuit, the path in virtual circuits is referred to as a virtual circuit."
"Each packet, referred to as a datagram, is considered as an independent entity in datagram networks(known as a packet-switching technology). Each packet contains destination information, which the switch makes use of to direct the packet to the desired location."
"Because there is no designated channel for a connection session in Datagram Networks, no resource reservations are required. The effect is that packets have a header with all of the destination's data."
"First-come, first-serve (FCFS) scheduling governs resource distribution in datagram networks."
A virtual circuit is easier to understand than a network of datagrams.
"A sort of wireless hacking technique called bluebugging uses flaws in Bluetooth-enabled devices to provide an attacker unrestricted access to a target device's data.

"Wireless network usage has grown significantly during the past several years. Wireless networks have a lot of benefits, but they can also be attacked by different security risks. The BlueSmack assault is one such danger."
"A Denial of Service (DoS) assault that targets Bluetooth-enabled devices is known as the BlueSmack attack. The attack includes flooding the victim device with many corrupted packets, which causes the device to freeze or crash. The assault takes its name from the well-known Smurf attack, which functions similarly."
"The BlueSmack attack takes advantage of a Bluetooth protocol flaw that enables an attacker to transmit plenty of unauthenticated packets to the target device. Simple tools, such the ""bluesmack"" script, which is publicly accessible online, can be used to attack this issue."
"A BlueSmack strike has the potential to have a big impact. Data loss or service disruption may occur as a result of the victim device becoming unresponsive or collapsing. In rare circumstances, the assault might leave the target device permanently damaged."
"It is crucial to adopt a number of preventative measures to guard against BlueSmack assaults. Disabling Bluetooth while not in use is one of the most efficient techniques to stop a BlueSmack assault. This might deter attackers from ever targeting your device. While using Bluetooth, it's critical to make sure your device has the most recent security updates."
"To further prevent unwanted access to your device, it is advised to utilize strong authentication methods like passwords or PINs. Also, it is crucial to exercise caution while connecting to unidentified devices since they could have been hacked and put to use as an attack gateway."
"Network administrators can also take action to protect their networks from BlueSmack attacks. Implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic monitoring tools may be part of this. Network administrators can also inform users about the dangers of Bluetooth-enabled devices and offer use recommendations."
"The BlueSmack assault poses a significant security risk to wireless networks, to sum up. Although if the attack has the potential to do substantial harm, it may be avoided by following the necessary safety measures. Users may defend themselves against BlueSmack attacks by turning off Bluetooth when not in use, utilizing robust authentication methods, and exercising caution while connecting to unidentified devices. By installing security measures and informing their users, network administrators may help stop BlueSmack assaults on their networks."
"Targeting Bluetooth-enabled devices, the BlueSmack attack is a sort of Denial of Service (DoS) assault. It entails flooding the target device's Bluetooth stack with a lot of data packets, resulting in a crash or loss of functionality. The BlueSmack assault can have substantial consequences on wireless networks, including the following:"
Disruption of Bluetooth connectivity: BlueSmack attack can disrupt Bluetooth connectivity between devices by overwhelming the target device with a flood of data packets. This can lead to a loss of connectivity between devices and affect their ability to communicate with each other.
Slow network performance: BlueSmack attack can cause a significant slowdown in network performance by consuming a large amount of bandwidth. This can affect the speed of data transfer and make the network less efficient.
"Device downtime: BlueSmack attack can cause the target device to crash or become unresponsive, leading to device downtime. This can have a significant impact on the productivity of the user and cause inconvenience."
"Security vulnerabilities: BlueSmack attack can also create security vulnerabilities in the network by exposing it to malicious attacks. Once the network is compromised, attackers can gain access to sensitive data and compromise the security of the entire system."
"Bluesmack attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets Bluetooth-enabled devices. To prevent Bluesmack attacks in a wireless network, you can take the following steps:"
"Disable Bluetooth: If you don't need Bluetooth connectivity, you can disable it on your device. This will prevent attackers from exploiting Bluetooth vulnerabilities to launch Bluesmack attacks."
Keep Bluetooth devices up-to-date: Make sure that your Bluetooth devices are updated with the latest firmware and security patches. This will help to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.
"Use strong passwords: If your Bluetooth devices require a password to connect, make sure to use a strong and unique password. This will make it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack the password."
"Limit Bluetooth device visibility: Configure your Bluetooth devices to be discoverable only when necessary, and to require authorization before connecting. This will limit the number of devices that can connect to your device and reduce the risk of Bluesmack attacks."
Use Bluetooth in secure environments: Avoid using Bluetooth in public places or other insecure environments where attackers can easily launch Bluesmack attacks. Use Bluetooth in secure environments or turn it off when you are not using it.
"Use Bluetooth with caution: Be cautious when using Bluetooth devices, especially when connecting to unknown devices or networks. Don't accept connections from unknown devices or untrusted sources."
"It's important to note that Bluebugging is illegal in most countries, and victims of such attacks should report them to the appropriate authorities. To protect against Bluebugging, users can take steps such as keeping their Bluetooth turned off when not in use, using strong passwords and authentication methods, and installing security updates on their devices."
"Wireless networks have become an indispensable element of our everyday life. They enable easy internet access and allow us to connect to other devices without the use of cords. Wireless networks, like any other technology, are vulnerable to many assaults, one of which being the Bluesnarfing attack."
"Bluesnarfing is a sort of Bluetooth-enabled gadget assault. Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to communicate across short distances with one another. Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as cellphones, laptops, and other electrical devices, are readily targeted by hackers who may utilize Bluesnarfing to steal sensitive data or take control of the device."
"Bluesnarfing is a form of Bluetooth attack that takes advantage of a flaw in the Bluetooth protocol to get access to the device's data without the owner's knowledge or consent. The attacker can then take sensitive data like contact lists, text messages, and even internet access."
"Bluesnarfing is a passive attack, which means that the attacker does not need to actively interact with the victim device. They can instead sit back and observe the wireless traffic between two Bluetooth devices. When an attacker discovers a susceptible device, they can use specialized software to get access to it and take the data."
"The Bluesnarfing attack's ability to be performed without the user's knowledge is one of its most worrying characteristics. The user may never be aware that their device has been hacked since the attacker can access the device's data without them knowing it. Because of this, users find it challenging to defend themselves against this kind of assault."
"Precautions must be taken in order to safeguard your device against Bluesnarfing. Make sure your Bluetooth is turned off when not in use since this is one of the best methods to safeguard your device. As a result, hackers won't be able to connect to your device and access your data."
Make sure your device is updated with the most recent security updates since this is another approach to protect it. Keeping your device updated with the most recent security updates will help stop attackers from taking advantage of Bluetooth vulnerabilities as these flaws are often identified and fixed.
"Therefore, it's crucial to exercise caution while pairing with unidentified Bluetooth devices. It's crucial to confirm a person's identification before enabling them to connect to your device over Bluetooth if they approach you when you're in a public setting."
"Bluesnarfing is a type of wireless hacking attack that targets Bluetooth-enabled devices to gain unauthorized access to personal data, such as contacts, messages, emails, and photos. The effects of a Bluesnarfing attack on wireless networks can be significant and include the following:"
"Theft of Personal Data: The primary effect of Bluesnarfing is the theft of personal data from Bluetooth-enabled devices. Attackers can access sensitive information, such as contacts, messages, and photos, without the user's knowledge or consent. This information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes."
"Compromise of Privacy: Bluesnarfing can compromise the privacy of individuals by exposing their personal data to unauthorized access. This can cause emotional distress, loss of reputation, and financial losses."
"Security Breach: Bluesnarfing can also result in a security breach in the wireless network. Attackers can use the stolen data to gain access to other devices and networks, causing widespread damage and loss."
Damage to Reputation: A Bluesnarfing attack can damage the reputation of businesses and organizations that fail to protect their wireless networks. Customers and clients may lose trust in the organization and may take their business elsewhere.
"Legal and Regulatory Consequences: In some cases, Bluesnarfing can lead to legal and regulatory consequences. Organizations that fail to protect their wireless networks may face fines, lawsuits, and other penalties."
"It's crucial to protect Bluetooth-enabled devices and networks with strong passwords, encryption, and other security measures in order to avoid Bluesnarfing attacks. To lessen the chance that vulnerabilities may be used against you, you should also regularly apply security patches and software upgrades."
"An attack known as ""bluesnarfing"" allows an attacker to get unauthorized access to data kept on a victim's device and is directed at Bluetooth-enabled devices. Several steps may be used to stop Bluesnarfing attacks on wireless networks:"
Turn off Bluetooth: One of the most effective ways to prevent Bluesnarfing is to turn off Bluetooth on your device when it is not in use.
"Use a strong PIN: When pairing your device with another Bluetooth-enabled device, use a strong and unique PIN (Personal Identification Number) to prevent unauthorized access."
Keep your device updated: Keep your device updated with the latest security patches and firmware updates. These updates often contain security fixes that can help prevent Bluesnarfing and other types of attacks.
Use encryption: Ensure that your Bluetooth connections are encrypted. Encryption will make it harder for attackers to intercept and access your data.
"Use trusted devices: Only connect to trusted Bluetooth devices. Be cautious when connecting to unknown devices or devices in public places, as these may be set up by attackers to steal your information."
Be aware of your surroundings: Be aware of your surroundings and who is in close proximity to you when using Bluetooth devices. Attackers can use Bluesnarfing from a distance of up to 300 feet.
Use security software: Consider using security software that can detect and prevent Bluesnarfing attacks.
You may dramatically lower the possibility of a Bluesnarfing attack on your Bluetooth-enabled device on a wireless network by taking these precautions.
"Wireless networks typically employ the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) modulation technology to spread the data stream over a wider bandwidth. To strengthen the signal's resilience to noise and interference, this technique spreads the signal over a larger frequency range than is really required for data transmission. DSSS is used by all wireless communication technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks. In this post, we'll go over the basics of DSSS and how it works in wireless networks."
"The data signal is multiplied by the spreading code, which is a signal used in DSSS that looks like noise. For this spreading code, a pseudo-random sequence of binary digits is generated at both the transmitter and the receiver. When the data signal is multiplied by the spreading code, which has a far greater bit rate than the data signal does, the result is a signal that appears random and has a much wider bandwidth than the original signal. After that, the signal is sent via the wireless channel."
The incoming signal is multiplied at the receiver using the same spreading code as the transmitter. Correlation is a technique for separating the original data stream from the spread spectrum signal. The data from the signal is subsequently extracted by the receiver using a demodulator.
"The ability of DSSS to provide security by making the signal seem random and challenging to decode without knowledge of the spreading code is one of its key features. Also immune to narrowband interference from other wireless devices, DSSS signals are unaffected by other signals operating in the same frequency range."
"Because it transmits the data signal over a wider frequency band than other modulation schemes, DSSS can also offer a higher data rate. This qualifies it for use in high-speed data transmission-dependent applications like streaming video and huge file transfers."
"DSSS, however, also has significant drawbacks. It can't be used in areas with crowded frequencies since it needs more bandwidth than other modulation methods. For the spreading code to be properly aligned, DSSS also needs exact temporal synchronization between the transmitter and receiver."
"Using a broad frequency band to spread the signal, direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a technique used in wireless networks to enhance performance. Using a pseudo-random bit sequence called a spreading code, the data is modulated using this method. The signal is then modified and sent over a broad frequency range. The following are a few DSSS in wireless networks effects:"
"Increased resistance to interference: DSSS signals are spread over a wide frequency band, which makes them less susceptible to narrowband interference. This means that DSSS signals are more resistant to interference from other wireless devices operating in the same frequency band."
Improved security: DSSS signals are more difficult to intercept and decipher than narrowband signals. The use of a pseudo-random code makes it challenging for unauthorized users to decode the data.
Increased bandwidth utilization: DSSS signals occupy a wider frequency band than narrowband signals. This means that DSSS can transmit more data in a given period than narrowband signals.
"Improved signal quality: DSSS signals can overcome signal fading, which occurs when the signal strength decreases due to attenuation or reflection. DSSS signals can overcome this by using the spreading code to maintain the signal strength."
Greater range: DSSS signals can travel further than narrowband signals because they have a lower power spectral density. This means that DSSS signals can be used in environments where narrowband signals may not be practical.
"In conclusion, DSSS is an effective method for enhancing the functionality of wireless networks. It offers better security, better bandwidth usage, better signal quality, and longer range in addition to increased resistance to interference."
Wireless networks use the direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) approach to spread the signal over a larger bandwidth than the original signal. This enhances wireless communication's dependability and security. Following are some safety measures you can consider when utilizing DSSS in wireless networks:
Use frequency-hopping: Frequency-hopping is a technique where the frequency of the signal is changed periodically. This helps to avoid interference from other signals and also makes it difficult for eavesdroppers to intercept the signal.
"Use encryption: Encryption is the process of converting data into a secret code so that it can only be deciphered by authorized parties. By using encryption, you can protect your data from being intercepted by unauthorized parties."
"Use strong passwords: Use strong passwords to protect your wireless network from unauthorized access. A weak password can be easily cracked, making it easier for unauthorized users to gain access to your network."
Use authentication: Use authentication to verify the identity of users before allowing them to access your network. This can be done by requiring users to enter a username and password or by using other authentication methods such as biometric authentication.
Use firewalls: Firewalls can help to prevent unauthorized access to your network by blocking traffic from untrusted sources. Make sure that your firewall is configured properly and that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
Use updated software: Keep your software updated with the latest security patches and updates to protect your network from new security vulnerabilities.
Conduct regular security audits: Conduct regular security audits of your wireless network to identify and address any security vulnerabilities.
You may contribute to ensuring the security and dependability of your wireless network when utilising DSSS by taking the necessary safeguards.
"Warchalking, sometimes known as ""wardriving,"" is the practise of publicly identifying the physical locations of wireless network access points. The phrase ""warchalking"" is derived from the words ""wardriving"" (the process of driving about seeking for wireless networks) and ""chalk,"" which is used to identify the position of the network."
"Warchalking became popular in the early 2000s, when wireless networks were readily available to the general population. Wireless networks were not as secure at the time as they are now, and it was quite simple for someone with a wireless-enabled device to join an unprotected network without the owner's consent."
"Warchalking aficionados would use a variety of symbols and codes to denote the location of the network to assist identify it. A simple ""W"" sign, for example, might be used to show the presence of a wireless network, but a more sophisticated symbol could be used to communicate the network's security level or other features."
"While warchalking was once considered as a harmless hobby or a method to communicate knowledge about wireless networks, it rapidly became contentious. Because it entailed accessing someone else's wireless network without their permission, many people considered warchalking as trespassing or even stealing."
Wireless network security procedures have gotten significantly more strong in recent years to address these challenges. Most wireless networks nowadays are encrypted and need a password or other form of authentication to get access. This makes it far more difficult for someone to get unauthorized access to a wireless network.
"Despite these advancements, warchalking retains a modest following among hobbyists who see it as a method to explore and understand their local wireless landscape. Warchalking is also used by some to advocate the usage of open, public wireless networks or to raise awareness about the necessity of wireless security."
"Overall, warchalking is an interesting and controversial phenomenon that highlights the ongoing evolution of wireless technology and its impact on our daily lives. While it may not be as relevant today as it was in the early days of wireless networking, it is still worth understanding as a part of the history of this important technology."
The technique of marking buildings or public areas with symbols that identify the location and characteristics of adjacent wireless networks is known as warchalking. The goal is to produce a map of accessible wireless networks in a given region that may be used by anyone looking to locate and connect to these networks.
"While warchalking can be beneficial for gaining access to wireless networks, there are various potential side effects and repercussions to consider:"
"Security Risks: Warchalking can potentially compromise the security of wireless networks. By making the location of these networks more widely known, it can increase the likelihood that unauthorized users may attempt to access them, potentially leading to data breaches or other security risks."
"Network Overload: Warchalking may also result in increased demand for available wireless networks, leading to slower speeds or even network downtime if too many users attempt to connect simultaneously."
"Legal Issues: In some cases, marking public spaces with symbols may be considered a form of graffiti or vandalism, potentially resulting in legal consequences for those who engage in the practice."
"Privacy Concerns: Warchalking can also raise privacy concerns, as the practice involves collecting and sharing information about the location and properties of wireless networks without the consent of their owners."
"Thus, while there may be some advantages to warchalking, it is critical to thoroughly assess the potential implications and repercussions before engaging in the activity. It is also critical to respect wireless networks' privacy and security, and to obtain permission from their owners before attempting to access them."
"This practice can be used by attackers to identify vulnerable networks and launch attacks, such as unauthorized access or eavesdropping.To prevent warchalking in wireless networks, here are some measures that can be taken:"
"Disable SSID broadcasting: By disabling the broadcast of the network's SSID, it will not appear on the list of available networks and make it harder for attackers to find."
"Use strong encryption: Using strong encryption, such as WPA2, can help prevent unauthorized access and eavesdropping. It is recommended to use the strongest encryption method that is supported by wireless devices."
Use strong passwords: Strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack can prevent unauthorized access to the wireless network.
Regularly change passwords: Regularly changing passwords can prevent attackers from accessing the network even if they manage to obtain the password.
"Enable MAC address filtering: By enabling MAC address filtering, only devices with authorized MAC addresses can connect to the wireless network."
"Monitor the network: Regularly monitoring the network for unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or unexpected changes in network settings, can help detect and prevent attacks."
Educate users: Educating users on the risks of warchalking and the importance of strong passwords and encryption can help prevent attacks.
"By implementing these measures, wireless networks can be better protected against warchalking and other attacks."
"The foundation of the contemporary digital era is wireless networks. They have completely changed how we exchange information and communicate. Yet, there are certain disadvantages to this innovation, particularly in terms of security. The WEP crack method is one example of a hacking technique that can be used on wireless networks."
"Wireless networks are protected by the security standard known as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). It was first released in 1999 to take the place of the unsafe WEP protocol. Its purpose was to offer security protections comparable to those in wired networks.However, it was eventually discovered that WEP had significant security holes that hackers could exploit."
"A WEP-secured wireless network can be broken into using the WEP crack method. Data packets sent over the network are intercepted and examined as part of the approach. The wireless network is secured by the WEP protocol, which employs a shared key authentication system. Data sent over the network is encrypted using the shared key."
"The WEP protocol's flaw is that it makes use of a fixed encryption key. Hence, if a hacker gets their hands on the key, they can quickly decrypt all data packets sent across the network. The WEP crack technique takes advantage of this flaw by intercepting a significant portion of data packets being sent over the network. The network's encryption key can then be broken by the hacker using a cracking programme."
The keys to WEP encryption can be cracked using a variety of techniques. These tools analyse the intercepted data packets using a number of different methods in order to identify the encryption key. Aircrack-ng is one of the most widely used tools for WEP cracking. Powerful software called Aircrack-ng can quickly decrypt WEP keys.
"The hacker must first capture a large enough quantity of data packets sent over the network in order to use Aircrack-ng. A wireless network card that supports packet capture can be used for this. After being captured, the packets are examined with Aircrack-ng to ascertain the encryption key."
"You can defend your wireless network against WEP cracking in a number of ways. Using a more advanced wireless security protocol, such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2, is the most efficient method (Wi-Fi Protected Access II). These protocols are much harder to break than WEP because they employ greater encryption techniques."
"Using a strong, complex encryption key is another technique to defend your wireless network against WEP breaking. The key should be periodically changed and have a minimum length of 128 bits. Hackers will find it far more challenging to decipher the encryption key as a result."
"Wireless networks are protected by the security standard known as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). Due to its flaws, it is currently regarded as old and insecure, and there are numerous ways to break WEP encryption. The following are the results of WEP cracking in wireless networks:"
"Unauthorized Access: The most significant impact of cracking WEP encryption is unauthorized access to the wireless network. An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal information, by intercepting and decoding network traffic."
"Network Disruption: Cracking WEP encryption can also disrupt the wireless network by causing packet collisions, network congestion, and network downtime. Attackers can also launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can render the network inaccessible."
"Increased Risk of Malware and Viruses: Once an attacker gains access to a wireless network, they can inject malware and viruses into the network. These malicious programs can spread throughout the network, infecting other devices and compromising their security."
"Legal Implications: Cracking WEP encryption is illegal in many countries, and individuals caught doing so can face severe legal consequences. The legal implications of WEP cracking can include fines, imprisonment, and other legal penalties."
"The WEP crack method has serious effects on the stability and security of wireless networks overall. To safeguard their networks from illegal access and other security risks, network managers must implement stronger security protocols, such as WPA2 or WPA3."
"The WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption standard for wireless networks is no longer considered secure and can be easily cracked by attackers. To prevent WEP crack attacks, it is recommended to use more secure encryption standards such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2."
Here are some additional steps you can take to improve wireless network security:
"Change default passwords: Ensure that all default passwords for wireless access points, routers, and other network devices are changed to strong, unique passwords."
Use strong encryption: Use WPA2 encryption or other strong encryption methods for securing wireless networks.
Disable SSID broadcasting: Disabling the broadcast of the wireless network's Service Set Identifier (SSID) can prevent unauthorized users from discovering your wireless network.
Enable MAC address filtering: Enable MAC address filtering on your wireless network to allow only specific devices to connect to the network.
Use a firewall: Install and configure a firewall to block unauthorized access to your wireless network and to monitor network traffic.
Keep software updated: Keep all wireless network devices and software up-to-date with the latest security patches and firmware updates to fix known security vulnerabilities.
"By following these best practices, you can help prevent WEP crack attacks and improve the overall security of your wireless network."
"The technique of securing wireless networks against unauthorized access and data breaches is known as wireless security encryption. To ensure that sensitive data carried over wireless networks is safe and protected against eavesdropping, interception, and other sorts of assaults, it entails the use of encryption techniques and protocols."
"From home networks to mobile devices, Wi-Fi hotspots at hotels and cafes have become an integral part of our daily lives. Wireless networks are convenient, but this also leaves them open to security risks. Hackers and fraudsters may quickly access network traffic, intercept wireless signals, and steal sensitive data including passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information."
"Data is encoded and rendered unreadable to unauthorized users to protect wireless networks from such attacks. Wireless encryption comes in a variety of forms, including WEP, WPA, and WPA2, each with a different level of security and strength."
"Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP, is the most traditional and insecure type of wireless encryption. Data is encrypted using a shared secret key, but brute-force attacks can quickly decrypt the key. As a result, WEP has lost favor and is no longer regarded as a secure encryption technique."
"As a substitute for WEP, WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) was developed and offers a greater level of protection. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol, or TKIP, is a more powerful encryption method and key management technique used by WPA. Nonetheless, it has been discovered that WPA has flaws as well, particularly with the usage of weak passwords and the vulnerability of the TKIP protocol to assaults."
"Currently, the most secure wireless encryption standard is WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II). Data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) method, and a more robust key management system is provided. Message integrity checks, which identify any tampering with network traffic, are one of the additional security measures included in WPA2. Nonetheless, flaws have been found, and even WPA2 is not totally impervious to attacks."
"It is crucial to adhere to best practices including using strong passwords, changing default usernames and passwords, and routinely updating firmware and security patches in order to further improve wireless security. Moreover, it is recommended to utilize virtual private networks (VPNs) to block remote management access to wireless networks and encrypt data when utilizing public Wi-Fi networks."
"Our daily lives have become increasingly dependent on wireless networks, which give us access to the internet and information from everywhere. Although wireless networks are convenient, there are security dangers because wireless signals can be intercepted and perhaps exploited by hostile people. Wireless security encryption techniques are used to encrypt wireless signals and guarantee secure communication in order to safeguard wireless networks and their users. The many forms of wireless security encryption and their advantages will be covered in this article."
"Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): WEP is one of the earliest wireless encryption protocols used to protect wireless networks. It uses a shared key to encrypt data and authenticate users. However, WEP is now considered weak and easily hacked, making it an unreliable encryption technique."
"Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): WPA is a more secure wireless encryption protocol that was introduced to replace WEP. It uses a stronger encryption algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to encrypt wireless signals. WPA also supports authentication mechanisms like 802.1x and can use a pre-shared key (WPA-PSK) for simpler setups. However, WPA can still be vulnerable to attacks, especially when using a weak pre-shared key."
"Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2): WPA2 is the most widely used wireless security encryption protocol today. It uses the same AES encryption algorithm as WPA but introduces additional security measures, including stronger key management and better authentication methods. WPA2 is also backward compatible with WPA, making it easy to upgrade older networks."
"Wi-Fi Protected Access III (WPA3): WPA3 is the latest wireless security encryption protocol that was introduced in 2018. It introduces several new security features, including Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which replaces WPA-PSK for easier and more secure authentication. WPA3 also offers better protection against password guessing attacks and stronger encryption algorithms for more secure communication."
"Transport Layer Security (TLS): TLS is a security protocol used to secure internet communications, including wireless networks. It encrypts data during transmission, providing end-to-end security. It uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques to ensure secure communication between two devices. TLS is widely used in web applications, email, and instant messaging services."
"To sum up, wireless security encryption is essential for maintaining secure communication across wireless networks. The kind of encryption employed is determined by the setup's complexity and the needed level of security."
"Although WEP and WPA are still in use, WPA2 and WPA3 are the most popular encryption protocols because of their more robust security features. TLS is another trustworthy security protocol that is used to protect internet connections. Your wireless network needs to be adequately secured to guard against unauthorized access and potential security breaches."
"Wireless networks are now a crucial component of business infrastructure. Although they make it easy to access the internet, internal resources, and other applications, they also pose serious security risks. In a corporate setting, wireless network security is essential for safeguarding sensitive data, upholding compliance, and averting potential legal and reputational problems."
"In this post, we'll talk about the value of wireless security in the workplace, the difficulties businesses have in protecting their wireless networks, and the best practices to follow."
"Several firms are switching to wireless networks as their primary form of connectivity as they have become the preferred way to access the internet. Wireless networks, however, are fundamentally less secure than wired networks, which attracts cybercriminals as targets."
"Radio waves are used by wireless networks to convey data, and anyone nearby the wireless access point has the ability to intercept this communication. Because of this, it is crucial that businesses put strong wireless security measures in place to safeguard their networks and data."
"The quantity of devices that connect to wireless networks presents one of the biggest security challenges. The wireless network is hard to manage and secure since so many people connect to it, including visitors, contractors, employees, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices."
"The wireless network's range poses another difficulty. Radio waves have a long range, making it challenging to limit the network's reach inside an enterprise. The wireless network can be attacked from outside the organization's physical limits, making internal and external network security crucial."
"To ensure wireless security in an enterprise environment, organizations should implement several best practices:"
"Secure Wireless Access Points: All wireless access points should be secured with strong passwords, and administrative access should be limited to authorized personnel only. Regular security audits should be conducted to ensure that access points are configured correctly and that they are not vulnerable to attack."
"Use Encryption: Wireless traffic should be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm such as WPA2 or WPA3. This ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the wireless traffic, they will not be able to read the data."
"Use Network Segmentation: The wireless network should be segmented from the rest of the organization's network. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the wireless network, they will not be able to access sensitive data on other parts of the network."
Implement Access Control: Access to the wireless network should be controlled through user authentication and authorization. This ensures that only authorized personnel can connect to the wireless network and that access is restricted based on their level of authorization.
"Regularly Update Security Measures: Security measures should be regularly updated to ensure that they are up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities. This includes updating firmware, software, and security policies."
"In business settings, wireless security is essential to safeguard sensitive information and guarantee secure communication. The following are crucial actions to take while implementing wireless security in a business:"
"Employ WPA2 encryption: Adding WPA2 encryption to your wireless network is an essential first step in securing it. More security is offered than with WPA or WEP encryption. AES encryption, one of the most secure encryption technologies, is used by WPA2 encryption."
"Employ strong passwords: For your wireless network, use strong passwords, and make sure to change them frequently. Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and comprise a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols."
"Implement a strong authentication mechanism: Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as 802.1x, which requires users to provide a username and password to access the wireless network."
Disable SSID broadcasting: Disabling SSID broadcasting can help prevent unauthorized access to your wireless network. It makes it more difficult for attackers to discover your network's name and connect to it.
"Use MAC address filtering: Use MAC address filtering to allow only specific devices to connect to your wireless network. This method can be effective, but it's not foolproof since MAC addresses can be spoofed."
Implement a firewall: Implementing a firewall can help protect your wireless network from external threats. A firewall can block unauthorized access attempts and prevent malware from spreading across the network.
Regularly update firmware and software: Regularly update the firmware and software of your wireless access points and other network devices to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities.
Regularly monitor network activity: Regularly monitor your wireless network for unusual activity or anomalies. This can help you detect and respond to potential security threats.
"In order to safeguard sensitive information and ensure secure communication, wireless security must be implemented in an organization. You may build a strong and secure wireless network that satisfies the requirements of your firm by adhering to these crucial measures."
"Because wireless networks are susceptible to unauthorized access, data theft, and other security risks, wireless security is a major problem for businesses. The following are some benefits and drawbacks of wireless security in the workplace:"

"Quantum networking is a rapidly growing field of research and development that seeks to combine the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory to enable secure and efficient communication between quantum devices. Traditional classical networks transmit the information as binary digits (bits) that are either a 0 or 1. In contrast, quantum networks use quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, creating more complex communication protocols that are inherently resistant to eavesdropping."
"The key advantage of quantum networking is the ability to transmit information in a fundamentally secure way due to the principles of quantum mechanics. For example, quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols can be used to establish a secret key between two parties, allowing them to communicate with complete privacy. Even if an eavesdropper attempts to intercept the communication, the act of measurement changes the state of the qubits. It can be detected, alerting the legitimate parties to the presence of the eavesdropper."

Maximum segment size and maximum transmission unit are essential parameters representing the size of the data packet transmitted into the network. These are important as they enable the user to decide the packet size or frame that can be successfully transferred from one node to another. The user can determine the maximum packet size that can be transferred between the nodes without dropping or splitting if the values of these two parameters are known. It allows the user to transfer the data packets efficiently in the networking.
MSS refers to the maximum TCP Segment Size. This term is used in the network when the three-way handshake establishes the node connection. This method ensures that both nodes meet all the basic conditions required to implement the networking protocol.
"MTU is an abbreviation for maximum transmission unit; here, the sender node determines the capacity of the host node in the network to send or receive the block of data as a single unit at a point in time. The maximum Segment Size is more advanced and secure than the maximum transmission unit. MSS is an upgraded version of the MTU."
"Before starting the data transmission in the network, the node has to compute the largest data packet size that can be shared in the network as a single entity that can be transported by the network link and accepted by the receiver node. The data packet should be such that it could also pass through the intermediary nodes in the network. If the data packet size is set too high, then the data packet is fragmented or even dropped from the network, and if the data packet is too small, then the network resources won't be efficiently utilized. It means that if the maximum transmission unit increases during the data transmission in the network, it represents that a single, strong connection can be established between the nodes, and the data transmission will be efficient. Since the user can send more data at once, that will reduce the data payload on each data packet in the network, which means less redundant data is transmitted."
MTU is used for defining the ability of the host node in the network to send or accept the block of data and files as a single entity at a particular point during the transmission. The node is responsible for determining the most optimal data packet size that can be sent in the network. It is essential for efficiently conveying the data within different nodes in the network. It also affects the routing path in the network. The maximum transmission unit is always greater than the maximum segment size as it includes additional data such as TCP/IP header. It includes the source and destination address.
The user can compute the MTU if the MSS value is provided to the user. The formula for computing the MTU is as follows:
The unit of MTU and MSS is bytes. It contains essential information for successful data transmission in the network. Here the 40 bytes of the data represent the additional data added as data payload to each data packet in the network.
It is a TCP header field that states the bits of the data that represent the maximum amount of data carried by the network packet. It is only implemented in the nodes that use TCP/IP handshake to establish the connection between nodes in the network. The nodes use the three-way handshake to ensure that the basic requirements for the data transmission and implementing the network protocols are implemented in the network.
Both MSS and MTU are used to perform the same task and almost perform the functions. The difference in the working of MSS and MTU is that MSS can only be computed when TCP protocol is implemented in layer 4 of the OSI model.
"The three-way handshake is only performed once between the nodes in the network. When the user adds a new node to the network with a server, a handshake is performed between the new node and the server. It starts with adding the header payload file in the header of the TCP. MSS is preferred over MTU as it is more secure than MTU. Most new devices use TCP/IP to connect with the network; therefore, MSS is more commonly implemented. It determines the value by which the data segments' fragmentation in the header will occur at the transport and tunnel mode of the TCP/IP protocol."
MSS is always smaller than MTU as it is the size after excluding the header size. The user can use the Maximum transmission unit to determine the maximum segment size in the node. The formula to compute the MSS is as follows:
MSS = MTU - 40 (IP header + TCP header)
The unit of MSS and MTU is bytes. It contains essential information for successful data transmission in the network. Here the 40 bytes of the data represent the additional data added as data payload to each data packet in the network.
"Though both the MSS and MTU perform almost the same functions, there are several differences between MTU and MSS. Some of these are as follows:"
"MTU stands for maximum transmission unit in computer networking. It refers to the largest data frame or packet that can be transferred between the nodes using the connection. The size of the frame or the packet is computed in bytes or octets, where one octet is an eight-bit byte. This term is widely used to represent the packet size in an Ethernet connection implemented using the Internet Protocol. However, there is a difference between MTU and maximum frame size."
"The greater maximum transmission unit is related to the reduced overhead. At the same time, if the MTU value is less, it can reduce the delay in transmission in the network. In most scenarios, MTU is determined by the underlying network capacity. It should be managed either manually or automatically so that it does not surpass the network's capacity."
Some nodes can adjust the maximum transmission unit when connecting with the other node. This is done by using Path MTU Discovery. MTU parameters may be represented with the communications interface or standard.
MTU is used in network layer protocols and other protocols associated with communications. The MTU is described in bytes or octets of the largest protocol data unit that the network layer can further transmit.
"MTU parameters are specified with the communication interface in the network, that is, serial port or NIC. The transmission standards such as Ethernet can define the size of the MTU. Nodes can also determine the size of MTU during the connection."
"The data link and the physical layers in the network usually increase the overhead in the network layer data to be transmitted. So if the user is provided with the maximum frame size of the data transmitted in the network, then the user must subtract the amount of overhead to compute the maximum transmission unit of the data."
"For instance, if the user uses an Ethernet connection, the maximum frame size is 1518 bytes, where the MTU is 1500 bytes only, and the rest of the 18 bytes are the overhead data added by the network layers to the data frame. This includes components such as headers and checks sequence numbers."
"Each node in the network has a limit to the maximum transmission unit size that can be transmitted or received by that node in the network. The node determines the MTU of the next receiving node in the network before sending the data frame to that node. This is done to ensure that the packet size is not larger than the MTU of the node. If it is larger, then it won't accept the data frame. Thus, the packet is first divided into smaller parts. The process is known as fragmentation of the data frame."
"Though performing fragmentation is not ideal as it reduces the performance of data transmission by adding delay and overhead data to the data, to ensure the best performance of the network, the MTU of the original transmitting node should be kept as high as possible; the value should be still less than the MTU of all the nodes connected in the network that are connected between the sender and final receiving node in the network. It is impossible to set these values automatically the first time because the sender node does not know the maximum transmission node for all the nodes in the network. The sender node only knows the MTU of the next node in the transmission."
The user can think of MTU as the maximum weight that can be transported as a single package. Consider if an organization wants to transfer 1000 kg of goods to another location. The goods are initially stored in a warehouse with trucks that can be used to deliver the goods. The complete shipment is packed into a single package and delivered as a single package. This is similar to transmitting the data between the nodes with a large MTU where all the nodes should support the MTU. It is very efficient as there is no requirement to instruct multiple transporters with information.
"Now consider another example where the organization needs to transport the same amount of goods to a smaller organization. The smaller organization lacks resources to transport the resources. They can only accept the goods from a mail carrier that has a small van. If the company sends the entire order through a single large package, the organization would have to split this larger package into smaller boxes to be transported further in the smaller van and delivered to the smaller organization. This is similar to the scenario where the sender node only supported the larger MTU, which is too much to handle by the receiver or intermediary node. The more appropriate approach will be where the MTU is determined by the original sender, in this case, the bigger organization, such that it can be supported by all the intermediary nodes rather than performing fragmentation at an intermediate load. This will be more efficient as the overhead will be added once during transmission. Moreover, it may be possible that fragmentation will be performed by multiple intermediary nodes, reducing the transmission performance."
"Packet fragmentation is only possible in Internet Protocol Version 4.0 (IPv4). Suppose the sender node transmits a data packet larger than the MTU over IPv4. The protocol automatically performs fragmentation of the data packet. This step is not performed if the data packet has a do-not-fragment flag set. The IPv6 protocol does not support fragmentation. If a packet larger than MTU is detected in the network, it is dropped from the network."
"The Ethernet frame is in the data link layer of the OSI model. It is the second layer in Open System Interconnection. The standard size of the Ethernet maximum transmission unit is 1500 bytes. The maximum frame size transmitted using Ethernet is 1518-1520. This 18-20 bytes of data comprises the header and additional overhead of the data frame. It is also theoretically the maximum size of the data frame that can be transferred using a physical cable. The MTU from any higher-level protocols must range within the standard MTU. If the data frame size exceeds the MTU, then it can't be transmitted by the Ethernet."
"The Internet Protocol is implemented in the third layer of the Open System Interconnection. The size of the IP MTU packet can be determined independently of the size of the Ethernet frame. The size of the IP MTU must be smaller than the size of the Ethernet frame because, in the end, the data frame is transmitted using the Ethernet cable. The IP MTU comprises the size of the data frame and the overhead data. It includes the header and the data payload transmitted with the frame. The size of the TCP/IP header is about 40 bytes."
"Returning to the analogy, consider the maximum weight the forklift can lift is 1500 kg. And the size of each package is 70 kg. Then the maximum weight that can be loaded on the forklift will be 1470 kg. Adding one more package will exceed the maximum limit of the forklift."
"Suppose the network implements an additional intermediary protocol during data frame transmission. Some protocols implemented between transmissions are GRE, SNAP or IPsec. However, these protocols are not included in the maximum transmission unit of the sender. It is necessary to consider the data from these protocols during the transmission. The user must include them during the network design to ensure that this does not exceed the maximum transmission unit of the intermediary nodes in the network."
"This protocol will add additional data to the data frame required to perform encryption on the data frame. Additional data will be added to the data frame. This additional data contains information about encryption. This increases the size of the data packet, ultimately exceeding the 1500-byte limit. For instance, if an institution fixes the maximum transmission unit size to 1500 bytes, it must transmit the data frame over a virtual private network that IPsec secures. Thus, the packet can no longer be transmitted through an Ethernet cable. Therefore, the packet is fragmented before transmission."
"To understand the above concept, consider the following analogy in which there is a warehouse that requires to keep safe the goods stored in the warehouse. They decide to store the entire shipment in a locked safe. If the weight of the locked safe used for storing the shipment is not taken into account, the total weight of the goods (data payload), pallet (header and flags), and the locked safe(IPsec) can exceed the total weight that the forklift can handle. Here forklift capacity represents the MTU of the node."
The packet is the data the sender node wants to transmit to the receiver node. It is the most data that the sender node can transmit in a single data packet without exceeding the MTU of the node. The maximum segment size represents the maximum size of the data payload in a data packet.
The user can compute the MSS by subtraction the header size from the IP MTU. The IP MTU is on the Layer 4 of the Open System Interconnection model.
"Jumbo frames are when the Ethernet MTU is more than the standard 1500 bytes. This is possible when the nodes are connected using fast Ethernet cables. If the user uses a Gigabit LAN, it increases the MTU to almost 9000 bytes. This is useful when you have reliable connections. This reduces the overhead by transmitting a larger volume of data as a single packet. It increases the efficiency of data transmission in the network."
"The size of the jumbo packet depends on the vendor. The jumbo frames are not guaranteed to be used over the internet. Therefore, these frames are avoided during transmission over the internet and are used to transmit data in a dedicated specialized network that ensures frame delivery. An example of this network is a storage area network (SAN). Since a large volume of data is handled in this network, using jumbo frames to optimize network performance is beneficial."
Path Maximum Transmission unit discovery (PMTUD) refers to determining the maximum transmission unit for all the nodes transversed by the data frame en route from the sender to the receiver. It is used to avoid frequent fragmentation of frames by the different nodes. It also prevents dropping data frames in the network where fragmentation is not supported. It is important to perform PMTUD in the network when multiple intermediary nodes are present to deliver the data packet. This may occur when the frame size exceeds the intermediary nodes' MTU.
"The easiest way to determine the MTU of a node is by sending large test data packets or pings set to not fragment. This ensures that fragmentation is not performed on the data frame. When the packet is dropped, it means the size of the packet is more than the node MTU. Thus, the size of the packet is decreased until it reaches the final node, and if the packets are successfully transmitted to the network, it sends the packet with a larger size. It is one of the methods to perform path MTU discovery."
"In the windows operating system, the user can determine the MTU of the node by using the ping command in the command prompt. The user can use the -f and -l switches to find the MTU. -f switch represents the do not fragment flag, while -l determines the data packet size in bytes that will be transmitted in the network. For example: ping javatpoint.com-f -l 1492"
"There is no standard best size that could be assigned for IP MTU. The user cannot set any particular value for all the nodes in the network. The maximum transmission unit is determined by the node and the protocols implemented in the node during the data transmission. This may vary between different nodes. Thus, it varies for different nodes in the network. This is another reason why the user must be careful while adjusting the endpoint MTU. Most nodes in the network can compute the MTU and adjust it accordingly to transfer the data to the next node. It depends on the type of connection and the network the two nodes use for communication."
"The most optimal value for the maximum transmission unit is closest to the lowest MTU value in the routing path. It is ensured that the optimal MTU value does not exceed the lowest MTU value of the node. If the user already knows particular constraints, then it is better to reduce the value of the MTU."
"For instance, if the user knows that the nodes in the organization use IPsec and VPN protocols, the user needs to set the MTU of the node to account for the overhead data that will be added because of the implementation of the given protocols. If not considered, it may increase the packet fragmentation in the network as the size after adding overhead may exceed the MTU. Certain internet service protocol technologies, such as ADSL, can add overhead data to the packet. It reduces the endpoint node MTU; so that it can ensure efficient performance."
"The Internet Protocol Suite was developed to be implemented over different network technologies. The different network technologies have different requirements and can use data packets of different sizes to transmit the data in the network. The host can determine the MTU of its node and compute the MTU of the peer node when performing the initial handshake. The host node does not know the lowest MTU in a network with multiple intermediary nodes. The nodes can compute the MTU for the next node in the routing path. Another issue lies with implementing higher-level protocols in the language, as they may add large data overhead to the data packet, increasing the size of the data packet to that supported by the local connection connecting the nodes."
"Internet protocol version 4 (IPV4) allows the node to fragment the data packet, which enables the node to split the datagram into smaller units. The size of each unit is such that it can be adjusted to a specified MTU limitation. This fragmentation function on the data frame is performed at the internet layer. The protocol marks the fragmented data packets to ensure that the IP layer knows the address of the destination node. As the datagram reaches the destination node, the fragmented datagram is reassembled to form the original datagram."
"Suppose the number of data packets is fragmented or the number of data packets increases significantly after performing fragmentation on the data. In that case, the additional data added to each fragmented packet can create large unnecessary data overhead in the network."
"To understand this problem, consider an example where several packets have crossed the maximum transmission unit by a very small margin. This increase is due to the additional data provided in the data packet's header. Though this additional data is very small, the data packets will still be required to be fragmented. Thus, each data packet will be split into two smaller parts, and the actual data, the data payload in the second fragment, will be very small. The same data is transmitted in the network. It means moving the same amount of data in the network. Each network router will have to send twice as many data packets into the network. It increases the traffic in the network."
To be a host to implement the Internet Protocol should be able to handle the IP datagram of at least 576 bytes to implement the IP version 4 or 1280 bytes to implement the IPv6 protocol in the network. This datagram size does not preclude the network layer with MTU smaller than the MTU mentioned above from transmitting the IP data.
"For instance, in IPv6, if a specific link layer cannot transmit the IP datagram of 1280 bytes as a single unit, then it is the responsibility of the link layer to perform fragmentation on the frame and provide a reassembling mechanism at the sender node. It is essential to provide fragmentation and assembly mechanisms to ensure that the transmitted data is rearranged and delivered correctly."
"The greater the value of the MTU, the more efficient the data transmission will be. It is because more data can be transmitted as a single unit in the network. It means that the number of data packets will be less to transmit the data in the network. Each data packet carries the same data and protocol overhead that stores data such as header. The increased data transmission efficiency means improved data transmission in bulk protocol throughput. It also means that there will be fewer data packets to be routed in the network to carry the same data. Some systems can process a fixed number of data packets. Thus, fewer data packets mean increased processing power in a system that can process a fixed number of data packets."
"There is a disadvantage to larger MTU as well. The larger the data packet being transferred will occupy the link for more time. This slows down the entire network. The smaller data packet is transported quickly in the network. This results in greater delays for the next data packets. It can cause network delay and delay variation in the network. For instance, if the nodes transmit the largest data packet possible that can be transferred via Ethernet cable in the network, that is 1500 byte data packet. It requires a 14.4k modem to transmit it further in the network for a whole second."
"Large packets also cause an issue if a communication error occurs during the data transmission. If no forward correction is implemented in the network, the entire data packet will have to be re-transmitted, even if only one bit of data is corrupted. This increases the network cost."
"For any bit error rate in the network, the data packets with larger MTU are more likely to be corrupted. The greater data payload makes the retransmission of these packets take more time. Despite the above negative effects of the"
"Larger packets are more susceptible to corruption at a given bit error rate. Their greater payload makes retransmissions of larger packets take longer. Despite the negative effects on retransmission duration, large packets can still have a net positive effect on end-to-end TCP performance."
"A mesh network is a type of network topology in which each node in the network can communicate directly with other nodes, without the need for a central hub or router. In a mesh network, each node acts as a relay for other nodes, passing on data packets to their intended destination. This means that mesh networks can be more robust and flexible than traditional networks, as they can automatically reroute traffic if a node fails or if there is congestion in the network."
"Mesh networks can be implemented using a variety of technologies, including wireless and wired connections. Wireless mesh networks use radio waves to connect nodes, while wired mesh networks use physical cables. Hybrid mesh networks combine both wireless and wired connections."
"Mesh networks are particularly useful in situations where traditional networks may be unreliable or difficult to set up, such as in disaster recovery efforts or in remote locations where infrastructure is limited. They can also be used in smart homes and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where a large number of devices need to be connected and managed efficiently. Overall, mesh networks offer a versatile and scalable approach to networking that can adapt to a wide range of situations and environments."
"There are several types of mesh networks that can be implemented, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most common types of mesh networks include:"
"Wireless Mesh Networks - Wireless mesh networks use wireless connections, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to connect nodes in the network. Nodes communicate with each other wirelessly, forming a mesh of connections that can be used to relay data across the network."
"Wired Mesh Networks - Wired mesh networks use physical cables, such as Ethernet or fiber optic cables, to connect nodes in the network. This can provide faster and more reliable connections than wireless mesh networks, but can also be more difficult to set up and maintain."
"Hybrid Mesh Networks - Hybrid mesh networks combine both wireless and wired connections, using wireless connections to provide flexibility and mobility, and wired connections to provide reliability and speed. This can be particularly useful in situations where some nodes are in fixed locations and others are mobile."
"Ad Hoc Mesh Networks - Ad hoc mesh networks are formed spontaneously, without the need for a pre-existing infrastructure or central authority. This can be useful in situations where traditional networking infrastructure is unavailable or unreliable, such as in disaster recovery efforts."
"Sensor Mesh Networks - Sensor mesh networks are designed specifically for IoT applications, using sensors to collect data and transmit it across the network. These networks can be used to monitor a wide range of variables, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, and can be particularly useful in industrial and environmental monitoring applications."
"Each type of mesh network has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of network type will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the application."
Mesh networks are made up of several components that work together to create a flexible and reliable network topology. Some of the key components of mesh networks include:
"Nodes: Nodes are the devices that make up the mesh network, such as routers, gateways, and endpoints. Each node can communicate directly with other nodes in the network, forming a mesh of connections."
"Routers: Routers are nodes that are responsible for forwarding data packets between nodes in the network. They can use various routing algorithms to determine the best path for data to travel through the network, ensuring that it reaches its intended destination."
"Gateways: Gateways are nodes that provide a connection between the mesh network and external networks, such as the internet. They can translate between different network protocols and formats, allowing data to be transmitted across different types of networks."
"Bridges: Bridges are nodes that connect different mesh networks together, allowing them to communicate with each other. This can be useful in situations where multiple mesh networks are being used in the same location or application."
"Backhaul: Backhaul refers to the connection between nodes in the network that carry the bulk of the traffic. In wireless mesh networks, backhaul is typically carried over high-speed wireless links, while in wired mesh networks, it is carried over physical cables."
"Controllers: Controllers are software or hardware components that are responsible for managing and monitoring the mesh network. They can provide centralized control and management of the network, as well as analytics and reporting tools for monitoring network performance."
"Each of these components plays a crucial role in the operation of the mesh network, working together to create a robust and flexible network topology. By distributing the routing and forwarding of data across multiple nodes, mesh networks can provide a more resilient and scalable approach to networking than traditional networks."
"Mesh networks offer a number of benefits over traditional networking architectures, including:"
"Robustness: Mesh networks are highly resilient and fault-tolerant, as the mesh topology allows data to be rerouted around any failed nodes or links. This makes mesh networks particularly well-suited for use in environments where reliability is critical, such as in disaster recovery efforts or in remote locations with limited infrastructure."
"Scalability: Mesh networks can be easily expanded or reconfigured by simply adding or removing nodes from the network. This makes them well-suited for applications that require a large number of connected devices, such as IoT applications."
"Flexibility: Mesh networks can be designed to operate using various types of connections, including wireless and wired connections. This makes them well-suited for use in a wide range of environments and applications."
"Reduced Latency: Mesh networks can provide lower latency than traditional networks, as data can be transmitted directly between nodes without the need to travel through a central hub or router. This can be particularly useful in applications that require real-time data transmission, such as online gaming or video conferencing."
"Lower Cost: Mesh networks can be more cost-effective than traditional networking architectures, as they can be designed to operate using inexpensive and readily available hardware. Additionally, the distributed nature of mesh networks can reduce the need for expensive infrastructure, such as network cables or centralized servers."
"Overall, mesh networks offer a flexible and scalable approach to networking that can adapt to a wide range of applications and environments. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, mesh networks can provide a more resilient and efficient approach to networking than traditional architectures."
"Mesh networks have a wide range of applications in various fields due to their robustness, scalability, and flexibility. Some of the most common applications of mesh networks include:"
"Smart Cities: Mesh networks can be used to create smart cities by connecting various devices, such as traffic lights, parking meters, and environmental sensors, to a central network. This can help to improve city planning, traffic management, and environmental monitoring."
"Disaster Recovery: Mesh networks can be deployed in disaster-stricken areas where traditional networking infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. They can provide a resilient and reliable communication network for first responders, aid workers, and affected communities."
"Industrial IoT: Mesh networks can be used in industrial settings to connect various sensors, machines, and equipment. This can help to monitor production processes, optimize workflows, and improve operational efficiency."
"Healthcare: Mesh networks can be used in healthcare settings to connect various medical devices and sensors, such as wearables and remote monitoring devices. This can help to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs."
"Military: Mesh networks can be used in military applications to provide reliable and secure communication in remote and hostile environments. They can be used for battlefield communication, remote surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control."
"Rural Internet Access: Mesh networks can be used to provide internet access to remote and underserved areas. By using wireless connections, mesh networks can provide a low-cost and scalable solution for bringing internet access to areas without traditional networking infrastructure."
"Overall, the flexibility and scalability of mesh networks make them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications in various fields. As the internet of things (IoT) and smart cities continue to grow, mesh networks are likely to play an increasingly important role in connecting various devices and sensors to a central network."
"While mesh networks offer numerous benefits, they also present some challenges and limitations, including:"
"Complexity: Mesh networks are more complex than traditional networking architectures, as they require specialized hardware and software to operate. Additionally, configuring and managing a mesh network can be challenging, particularly in large deployments."
"Bandwidth Limitations: Mesh networks can experience bandwidth limitations due to the need to forward data packets between nodes. As a result, they may not be suitable for applications that require high-speed data transfer or large amounts of bandwidth."
"Security: Mesh networks can present security challenges, particularly in wireless mesh networks where nodes communicate over shared radio frequencies. This can make them vulnerable to attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and unauthorized access."
Interference: Mesh networks can be susceptible to interference from other wireless devices operating on the same frequency band. This can cause reduced performance or even network failure.
"Power Consumption: Nodes in a mesh network require power to operate, which can be a challenge in applications where power is limited or not readily available. Additionally, the need to forward data packets between nodes can consume additional power, reducing battery life in mobile or battery-operated devices."
"Cost: While mesh networks can be more cost-effective than traditional networking architectures, the specialized hardware and software required to operate a mesh network can be expensive, particularly in large deployments."
"While mesh networks offer numerous benefits, they also present some challenges and limitations that need to be carefully considered when deploying and managing a mesh network. By understanding these challenges, it is possible to design and deploy a mesh network that meets the specific needs of a particular application or environment."
There are several mesh network standards that have been developed to ensure interoperability and compatibility between different mesh network devices and technologies. Some of the most widely used mesh network standards include:
"Zigbee: Zigbee is an open standard for low-power, low-data-rate wireless mesh networking based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Zigbee is widely used in home automation and building automation applications, as well as industrial and commercial settings."

"By using these standards, mesh network devices can communicate with each other regardless of the manufacturer or technology used. This makes it easier to create interoperable mesh networks that can be deployed in a wide range of applications and environments."
"The future of mesh networks is promising, with the potential to transform various industries and applications. Here are some of the trends and developments that are likely to shape the future of mesh networks:"
"5G Integration: As 5G networks continue to roll out globally, mesh networks are likely to integrate with 5G technology to create faster, more reliable, and more secure networks. This integration could lead to new applications and use cases for mesh networks, particularly in areas such as smart cities and industrial IoT."

Mesh networks have been deployed in a wide range of applications and industries. Here are some examples of mesh network deployments:
"Smart Homes: Mesh networks are widely used in smart home applications to enable communication between smart devices such as thermostats, lights, and security systems. For example, the Google Nest Wi-Fi system uses mesh networking to provide fast and reliable Wi-Fi coverage throughout a home."

However, with the continued development of emerging technologies such as 5G, edge computing, AI, and quantum computing, the future of mesh networks is promising, with the potential to transform various industries and applications."
An autonomous system (AS) consists of several connected Internet Protocol routing prefixes. One or more network operators manage all these routing prefixes in place of a single administrative entity or organization. These IP prefixes have a clearly defined routing policy that states how the autonomous system will exchange the routing data with other nodes and similar systems. Each autonomous system is provided with a unique autonomous system number (ASN) to implement in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing.
"Their regional internet registries provide the ASN to the Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and end-user organizations. It will receive blocks of autonomous system numbers from the reassignment from the Internet Assigned Number authority. The IANA is also responsible for maintaining a registry of the ASNs. This registry is only used for private use, and therefore they cannot be revealed on the internet."
"In simpler language, the as can be represented as a group of interconnected IP networks managed by only one organization, such as a college, university, or government. This entity performs control and management of these interconnected networks."
An autonomous system is a collection of several IP routing prefixes linked to each other. Each autonomous system has its routing policy. The routing policy comprises the list of IP address space the system manages. It also compromises a list of other autonomous systems to which the system is directly linked. This information is shared on the internet by implementing the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
An IP Address space refers to a specific group or range of IP addresses. Each autonomous system manages a certain number of IP address spaces. The collection of IP addresses can also be referred to as an IP address block.
"Consider that all the mobile numbers worldwide were ordered sequentially, and each mobile service provider is given a range of mobile numbers. Let's consider a company Mobile Co. A that manages mobile numbers between 00-00000 to 49-99999, and another company manages the numbers from 50-00000 to 99-99999. Suppose Person A makes a call to Person B on his mobile number, which is 44-47859, then the call will be routed to Person A via Mobile Co. A, but if the call is made to a different number, such as 88-37939, then it will be routed via Mobile Co. B."
"This is similar to the working of the IP address space. Consider a company AS Co. That runs an autonomous system and manages a range of IP addresses. The IP address 192.0.0.211 lies within the range managed by the AS Co. Thus, if any node in the network transmits a data packet to 192.0.0.211 then the data packet will be transmitted to the autonomous system managed by AS Co. If the node transmits to an IP address that is not included in this range then the data packet will be transmitted to a different autonomous system. It may pass through the system of AS Co. as an intermediary node."
"When the network engineers want to determine which IP Address is managed by which autonomous system, they determine it by discussing the IP address prefixes managed by each autonomous system. IP address prefix constitutes a range of IP addresses. The IP address prefixes are represented differently than the IP address. The IP address prefixes are represented as follows: 192.0.1.1/15. This means that the range of the IP address maintained by the AS is 192.0.1.1.0 to 192.0.1.1.225 and not from 192.0.1.1.0- 192.0.1.1.15."
The difference between an AS and other network groups is that the AS is represented as a single entity to any other external autonomous system. It means that each AS has only one coherent routing plan. The routing plan should be independent of how the communication is performed within the autonomous system.
An autonomous system consists of several routers handled by only one administrative body. The AS is presented with a unified interior routing plan to any other external autonomous system in the network. It provides a consistent image of the networks present in the AS.
"These systems are built around IP prefixes that can be implemented in class A, B, or C networks. When the networks are implemented with an autonomous system, the term prefix is equivalent to the CIDR block. CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a group of IP addresses with the same IP prefix and constitutes the same number of bits. Therefore, autonomous systems are also referred to as the routing domain."
An autonomous system can be divided into three categories. These categories are as follows:
Multihomed Autonomous System:An autonomous system with two or more external autonomous systems.
Transit Autonomous System:It acts as a connection between the autonomous system. It links the AS with the external AS.
Single Homed System:This autonomous system connects the AS with a single external AS.
"The Tier 1 ISPs, or the ISPs with big networks, manage the largest autonomous system. Each tier 1 ISP has its autonomous system. These ISPs create the backbone of the internet. They are responsible for managing the traffic flow in the network. They own and maintain the network infrastructure. The autonomous system of the ISPs is interconnected, allowing the transmission of worldwide packet exchanges through the network."
All connections between the tier 1 autonomous systems are non-commercial. This allows the nodes to transmit the data between different tier-1 systems freely.
"ISPs also help fund internet exchange points -- physical locations that facilitate packet exchange between ISPs and other entities. Tier 2 ISPs typically contract with Tier 1 ISPs to access the internet backbone, and Tier 3 ISP's contract with Tier 2 ISPs, which, in turn, contract with Tier 1 ISPs."
The unique number assigned to every autonomous system in the network is called the autonomous system number. It is used as an identifier for the system in the network. It is used when the autonomous system exchanges the routing data with the other system.
"An ASN supports both 16-bit and 32-bit formats. The 32-bit format was recently provided; all the ASNs provided till 2007 were in the 16-bit format. They can either be publicly visible to other nodes or private if the ASN wishes to exchange the routing information with the other autonomous system on the network. Then the AS must have an autonomous public system number. It enables other ASes to identify the other AS.if an autonomous system has a public ASN, all the routing paths that begin from the autonomous system are visible on the internet."
"If the autonomous system has a private ASN, it can facilitate communication with only one network provider. AS with private ASN needs a Border Gateway Protocol to communicate using the network. In this scenario, the routing paths originate from the AS, and the routing policy is unavailable on the internet."
The internet-assigned numbers authority controls the autonomous system number system. It is also responsible for distributing the ASNs in the five global regions. It coordinates with all the regions to efficiently assign the ASNs.
Each region has its regional internet registry that records the Autonomous system numbers assigned to the different AS in the particular region. The five regions and the area maintained by each region is as follows:
African Network Information Center: It manages the ASNs distributed all over the African continent.
Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre: It manages the ASNs assigned in the Asian and Pacific region.
American Registry for Internet Numbers manages the ASNs distributed in Canada and the United States. It includes some Caribbean Islands as well.
Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre: It manages the ASNs assigned to the autonomous network in Latin America and some Caribbean islands.
"Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre: It manages the ASNs in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia."
The public Technical Identifiers organization performs several functions of the IANA. These organizations are affiliated with the Internet Corporation Names and Numbers that manage the functions of IANA.
"There are several networks present in an autonomous system. The transmission of data within the network is performed using the routing data to each other using one or more interior gateway protocols. In contrast, communication between the AS depends upon a single exterior gateway protocol: Border Gateway Protocol. The protocol allows the AS to transmit the routing information and efficiently transmits the data packets among different AS. The BGP plays a crucial role in transmitting data over the internet. Therefore, it is also called the protocol that runs the internet."
BGP is a routing protocol implemented between AS; it exchanges network reachability data between the different BGP nodes. The BGP uses this information to transmit the data packets via the most efficient routes to the receiver's autonomous node.
"For performing the above function border gateway protocol implements Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as its transport protocol. It makes Border Gateway Protocol compatible with the entire internet network. The protocol does not need to perform explicit sequencing or retransmission functions. When the two nodes establish a TCP connection by performing the three-way handshake, they send data to ensure they meet the connection requirement. It is done by checking the requisitive parameters of both nodes."
The autonomous system implements BGP to tell the other autonomous systems that it is ready to establish a connection and for which IP address the AS manages is responsible. The routers that are used in the BGP communicate with each other throughout the connection. They update the routers and share the current routing information. The routing paths are updated continuously in the network. Each router that implements BGP also maintains a routing table that stores all the paths connecting different nodes in the network.
"BGP then utilizes this information and the autonomous system numbers forwarding the network topology that transmits the data packets via the most optimal routes. It prevents the sending of the data into network loops. The protocol depends upon a destination-based forward mechanism. In this mechanism, the data packet is transferred based on the destination address attached by the IP in the header. The routing policies must comply with this mechanism to deliver the packet to the destination node."
"It is the function of the internet protocol to route the transmitting data packet in the network. Internet protocol inserts an IP header in the data packets that store information such as the destination node address that determines the packet's final destination. BGP is used to direct the data packets to the most efficient path to this node. If the BGP protocol is not implemented, the data packet will reach the packets, which may take a long time. The IP packet would travel form different ASes on the internet to search the AS with the destination node. There will be no defined path for the data packet in the network."
"Autonomous Systems are linked with each other they transmit network traffic (data packets) to other AS. The process of transmitting packets from one AS to another is termed peering. One method the ASes use to connect directly with other AS is linking at physical locations known as Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). An IXP is a large local network with numerous routers, switches, and cable connections."
MSS is a term used in the computer network. It stands for the maximum segment size of the data packets. The network packet or data packet is the data that can be transferred using a network as a single unit. These are used to transmit the data in the IP transmissions sent via the internet or other network that communicate using internet protocol.
"This parameter sets the maximum limit to the network packet size that the node can send through a network such as the internet. All the data transmitted into the network is divided into several smaller chunks. These broken pieces of data are referred to as data packets. The additional data packet is provided additional information that describes the content in the data frame. It contains essential information for data transmissions, such as source and destination addresses. This information is attached as the header of the data packet. Maximum Segment Size computes the size of the non-header component of the network packet. This component is known as the data payload."
"In order to understand the concept of MSS, let us consider this analogy where a data packet can be represented as a transport truck. The header can represent the truck itself, while the payload is the trailer or the cargo being transported. There is a maximum capacity of the cargo that can be carried by trailer. If the trailer exceeds the particular capacity, then it may break, and the truck won't be able to continue its journey to the destination node."
MSS can be defined as the largest transport control protocol data segment size that can be transmitted and received by the nodes in the network. The data segment is described as the length of the data payload; it excludes the packet header. The MSS is computed in bytes.
MSS can be calculated using another metric unit to compute the size of the entire data packet. This unit is known as the MTU or the maximum transmission unit. MSS comprises the data payload and the TCP/IP headers.
"Considering the same analogy again, the MTU can be represented as the total weight of the entire truck, that is, the sum of the weight of the trailer/ cargo and the weight of the truck."
MSS is equal to the MTU if the TCP/IP header size is subtracted from the maximum transmission unit. The formula for MTU can be represented as:
The header size can be up to 40 bytes in a data packet.
"Another difference between the MTU and MSS is that if the data packet size is more than the node maximum transmission unit, the data packet can either be dropped or further divided into smaller pieces. These pieces are referred to as data fragments. But if the data packet size exceeds the MSS, then the packet is simply dropped and not delivered to the receiver node."
The Transport Control Protocol is a protocol that is responsible for ensuring the successful in-order delivery of the data packet. It ensures that none of the packets is lost during the transmission.
"Consider an example of a courier delivery called every courier receipt before the time. This will ensure that they will be home at a pre-decided time before transmitting the couriers. TCP works as the courier service in the networking, while the data packets act as the courier or the packages in the network."
The TCP begins its operation by establishing a connection between the nodes that will use the network to communicate and transfer the data. The connection is established using a method known as a three-way handshake or the TCP handshake.
The TCP is initiated by connecting the nodes to facilitate communication. The connection is established by performing a TCP handshake. The maximum segment size is determined by both nodes while performing the handshake. Both nodes determine the size of the data packets that either node can receive. This process is referred to as MSS clamping. TCP inserts additional data into each data packet. This header contains information regarding the connection and the sequence of the data packets. It also contains the sender and receiver port numbers essential for data transmission.
"The length of the TCP header is almost 20 bytes. The IP header contains additional data, such as the source and destination IP address. The length of the IP address is similar to that of a TCP header; it is also 20 bytes long. There are several optional header fields in the TCP and IP headers, but they increase the length of the headers and are used only when necessary."
Byte is a data unit that is used to represent the memory size of the computers. A byte represents eight binary digits that combine eight ones and zeroes.
"Consider a network router that has an MTU of 1500. it means that the maximum size of the data packet that can be transmitted using this network is 1500 bytes long. If the node transmits larger data packets through this router, then the data packets can be fragmented."
"As discussed above, the length of both the TCP and IP header is 20 bytes. Thus, to compute the MSS, subtract these headers' sizes from the MTU."
"Thus, the router MSS should be 1460 bytes. If the size of the data packets is more than 1460 bytes, the packet will either be fragmented or dropped from the network. A node can transmit an overly large data packet into the network if the device is not informed of the MTU and MSS of the network routers or any other intermediary node that will be used during the data transmission. The nodes can perform MTU discovery to ensure that such incidents can be prevented in the network."
"IPsec is the abbreviation for Internet Protocol security. It is an improvised version of the Internet Protocol, which is not secure. Data packets transmitted using the IPsec are encrypted to ensure that only the two nodes, that is, the sender and receiver node, can interpret the data. The data payload is kept secure from any other intermediary node. The protocol is used to establish virtual private networks."
"It increases the size of the data packets by adding a few additional bytes to the packet length. When using the protocol, this additional data must be taken into consideration when computing the MSS for the nodes."
The maximum segment size is computed in the transport layer. The metric is implemented when TCP is implemented. It is a transport layer protocol. It is similar to the maximum transmitted unit implemented in the OSI model's network layer.
"There may be instances where the network router is set to an MTU value less than the 1500 bytes standard that can be transmitted using the Ethernet connection. If the nodes are unaware of the lower MTU, this may lead to packet loss or difficulty in finding the data packet."
"In order to ensure that the data packet is successfully transmitted to the receiver node, the node could reduce the size of the incoming data packet payload. The reduction of size is possible by performing an MSS clamp. It is performed during the TCP handshake; the server can determine the MSS of the data packets and indicate to the nodes that it would accept the data packets within this range. This is called clamping, as the node clamps the maximum payload size it will receive from the other nodes."
"For instance, if two servers, say A and B, are trying to establish a TCP connection. The MSS value for the second server is 1430 bytes. After performing the TCP handshake, server A will transmit the maximum packet with a data payload size of 1430 bytes. This is limited until the connection is established."
"The MSS clamping can also be used to perform GRE tunnelling. In the GRE tunnelling, a 24-byte header is inserted into the original data packet meant to transmit to a new destination. The new data header contains information about the new receiver node in the network. If the size of the original data packet was more than 1476 bytes, then this would increase the size of the data packet from the typical 1500-byte maximum transmission unit. The data packet cannot be transmitted via Ethernet cable if the size exceeds the limits. Thus, we can use the MSS clamping technique to reduce the data payload size so that even if the largest GRE header is added to the data packet, the packet does not exceed the limit."
The default value of the TCP MSS is set to 536 bytes in most nodes in the network. The server node can modify the default value of the MSS. The option to modify the MSS is provided in the TCP. The server can use this option to modify the TCP SYN data packet value when performing a TCP handshake. It is impossible to change the MSS value once the connection between the nodes is established.
The inter-layer communication is done to notify the value of the MSS to the next layer. This is done to ensure that the value of the data packets does not exceed the maximum transmission unit. The communication is performed as follows:
The network driver or interface should be aware of the Maximum transmission unit that can be transmitted through the network directly attached to the node.
The IP communicates with the network driver. It asks the driver the Maximum transmission unit that can be sent through the network.
The TCP communicates with the internet protocol and determines the Maximum datagram data size (MDDS) that can be transmitted. The size of the MDDS is computed by subtracting the IP header from the MTU.
"When a TCP connection is established, the TCP provides an option that allows the server to modify the value of MSS. The value of MSS is set to subtract the TCP header length from the MDDS. Thus, the formula to compute the MSS is as follows:"
The inter-layer communication is also performed to transmit the TCP segment to the receiver node. The inter-layer communication is as follows in this scenario:
TCP computes the maximum segment data size (MSDS) by using the default or the received value of the MSS option.
The fragmentation of the data packet depends on the version of the IP used. The TCP communicates
with IP to ensure that the fragmentation can be performed.
"If fragmentation can be performed, the TCP can transmit the IP segments (including the TCP header) equal to MSDS + TCP header length."
"If the fragmentation cannot be performed, the TCP transmits the data packet to the IP. The segment size, including the TCP header, should be less than MDDS or (MSDS + TCP header length)."
"Internet protocol checks the size of the data packet transmitted by the TCP. If the length of the data packet is more than MDDS, then the packet will be dropped or fragmented. If it is less than or equal to MDDS, the IP header is added to the packet and forwarded to the network driver."
The network latency can be reduced by reducing the maximum data packet size that can be transmitted to the network.
"The value of the MSS is determined while performing the TCP three-way handshake. It cannot be modified after establishing a connection. Thus, the MSS is fixed for all the data packets. It remains the same for all the data packets transmitted in the network."
The OS can modify or set the maximum size of the segment transmitted by the nodes.
The operating system can be used to set or alter the maximum size.
"The TCP handshake determines the maximum segment size, but if the value assigned during the handshake is too low, then the traffic stream is divided into numerous little packets. This can reduce the performance of the network."
"If the size of the data packets is larger than the MSS, then the data packet is removed from the network."
"Network systems have evolved into the foundation of corporations, governments, and people in today's interconnected world. These platforms are used to collaborate, access resources from anywhere in the world, and share information. But, as our reliance on network systems grows, so too does the risk from cyberthreats. In order to protect the safety and security of the users as well as the system itself, cybersecurity in network systems has emerged as a major issue that must be addressed."
"Cybersecurity refers to the procedures, tools, and techniques used to safeguard network systems from intrusion, harm, or data theft. It includes a broad variety of steps intended to stop, find, and address online threats. Viruses, malware, phishing scams, ransomware, and denial-of-service attacks are just a few examples of the many different types of cyberthreats that might exist."
"Access control is a crucial component of cybersecurity in network systems. According to the user's identification and privileges, access control refers to the process of granting or refusing access to network resources. Passwords, biometric authentication, and access control lists are a few examples of authentication and authorization systems that can be used to do this. Access control helps guarantee that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and resources and helps prevent unauthorized access to them."
"Data protection is a crucial component of network system cybersecurity. Data protection refers to the steps taken to guarantee the privacy, accuracy, and accessibility of data. Encryption, backup and recovery, and data loss prevention techniques can do this. Data is encoded during the encryption process so that it can only be decoded using a decryption key. Data loss prevention techniques assist in stopping the leakage of private information, while backup and recovery procedures guarantee that data is safe against unintentional or deliberate deletion or damage."
"In network systems, network monitoring is also a crucial part of cybersecurity. In order to identify and address potential risks, network monitoring involves keeping an eye on network activity and traffic. Network analysis tools, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems can all be used to achieve this. Although firewalls filter incoming and outgoing network data to stop harmful activity, intrusion detection and prevention systems assist in identifying and thwarting unwanted access attempts."
"Finally, regular software and hardware patching are necessary for network systems' cybersecurity. Cybercriminals can use software and hardware flaws to install malware or obtain unauthorized access to network resources. The network system is secure thanks to regular updates and patches that help fix these vulnerabilities."
"In order to protect the safety and security of the users as well as the system itself, cybersecurity in network systems is crucial. Some of the most important steps that may be taken to improve network system cybersecurity are access control, data protection, network monitoring, and frequent updates and patches. As the reliance on network systems grows, it is essential to give cybersecurity top priority to avoid having cyberthreats jeopardize the availability and integrity of network resources."
"The importance of network security has grown in recent years, especially in light of the surge in cyberattacks and the susceptibility of computer networks. Network security is the term used to describe the precautions taken to guard against unauthorized users, damage, or misuse of a network. The main objective of network security would be to guarantee the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data sent through the network. This article will examine some of the most crucial facets of network security and offer some suggestions for enhancing network system security."
"Access control is one of the most crucial components of network security. Controlling access to the network and its resources is done through access control. Usernames and passwords, which are used to authenticate users and enable them access to the network, are often used to do this. Firewalls, that are software or hardware devices that restrict access to the network by obstructing unwanted traffic, can also be used to improve access control."
"Encryption is a crucial component of network security. Data is transformed into a code with the application of algorithms, which can only be decoded by a person who has the right key. Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, such as financial transactions or personal information, requires encryption. The application layer, transport layer, or network layer are only a few of the different network layers where encryption can be used."
"The usage of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) is another aspect of network security. IDS/IPS systems, which can be software or hardware, watch network traffic for indications of malicious activity. They can be used to identify and stop threats like malware infections or denial of service (DoS) assaults. IDS/IPS can be installed in the network at a number of locations, including the perimeter, inside the network, and at endpoints."
"The use of virtual private networks is a crucial component of network security (VPNs). VPNs offer an encrypted, secure link between the network and external users or sites. This is crucial for firms with multiple locations or remote employees. Anyone in the world can have safe access to network resources like files, apps, or databases with the use of VPNs."
"Finally, maintaining network security also entails patching and updating network hardware and software on a regular basis. This is necessary to keep the network secure and stop attackers from taking advantage of flaws. The hardware and software in the network, including firewalls, routers, switches, and servers, should receive regular updates and patches."
"To secure the privacy, accuracy, and accessibility of data sent across a network, network security is a crucial issue that must be treated seriously. Network security must be developed to guard against cyberattacks and other security risks. Key components include network access, cryptography, IDS/IPS, VPNs, and regular patches and updates. Organizations can strengthen the security of their network systems and safeguard their sensitive data from unauthorized access or harm by implementing the advice in this guide."
"Two crucial components of safeguarding digital systems and data from dangers are software security and cyber security. Although there are certain areas where the two overlap, there are also some significant variances. The distinctions among software security and cyber security are highlighted by the following points:"
"In conclusion, while cyber security is a wide phrase that includes all facets of safeguarding digital systems and data from threats, software security is a specific subset of cyber security that focuses on making sure that software systems are created and developed to be secure."
"Network Security: Cybersecurity is essential for protecting network infrastructure from cyber threats, such as hacking attempts, data breaches, and malware infections. Network security measures include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, VPNs, and network segmentation."

"Endpoint Security: Endpoint security is essential for protecting endpoints, such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, from cyber threats. Endpoint security measures include antivirus and anti-malware software, host intrusion prevention, and application control."
"Incident Response: Incident response is the process of responding to a cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach or cyber attack. Incident response measures include threat detection, containment, eradication, and recovery."
"A crucial component of network systems, information security works to safeguard data and information from unwanted access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, and destruction. The security of network systems is now more crucial than ever due to society's growing reliance on digital technology and the internet. In this post, we'll look at the idea of information security in network systems, how important it is, and some of the most effective methods and guidelines for doing it."
"A combination of practices, policies, and procedures called information security in network systems is intended to safeguard the privacy, availability, and integrity of data and information stored, processed, and sent across a network. It entails locating potential risks and vulnerabilities in network systems, putting those risks under control, and continuously assessing and enhancing the network's security posture."
Information security is essential in network systems for a number of reasons:
"Protection of sensitive information: Network systems often store and transmit sensitive information such as financial records, personal identifiable information (PII), and intellectual property. The security of this information is critical to protect the privacy and interests of individuals and organizations."
Compliance with regulations: Many industries are subject to regulations and standards that require the implementation of specific security measures to protect sensitive information. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in legal and financial consequences.
"Business continuity: Security breaches can cause disruptions to network systems, resulting in downtime and lost productivity. By ensuring the security of network systems, organizations can maintain business continuity and minimize the impact of security incidents."
"Reputation and trust: A security breach can damage an organization's reputation and erode the trust of customers, partners, and stakeholders. By prioritizing information security, organizations can build and maintain trust with their stakeholders."
"Access Control: Access control is the practice of restricting access to network resources to authorized individuals or systems. This can be achieved through the use of passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC)."
"Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access. Encryption is commonly used to secure data in transit, such as email messages and web traffic, as well as data at rest, such as files stored on a server."
Firewalls: Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. Firewalls can be implemented at the network or host level and are an effective way to protect against unauthorized access and malicious traffic.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are security technologies that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and can automatically block or alert security personnel about potential security incidents.
Patch Management: Patch management is the practice of regularly updating software and firmware to address security vulnerabilities and bugs. Timely patching is critical to maintaining the security of network systems.
"Employee Training and Awareness: Employees are often the weakest link in network security, as they can inadvertently expose sensitive information or fall victim to social engineering attacks. Regular training and awareness programs can help employees identify and prevent security incidents."
"The confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of data and information must be protected in network systems by means of information security. Access control, encryption, firewalls, IDPS, patch management, staff training, and stakeholder awareness are all tools that businesses can use to reduce the risk of security incidents and keep stakeholders' trust. In order to remain ahead of new threats and vulnerabilities, it is crucial to continuously evaluate and enhance the security posture of network systems."
"Network security has become increasingly important in the current digital era for maintaining the integrity and safety of our networks. The protection of a computer network and its data from illegal access, theft, or damage is referred to as network security. Security precautions must be taken in network systems to protect the network from various forms of assaults, including malware, phishing, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and more."
"The installation of firewalls is one of the crucial phases in network security. A firewall is a piece of hardware or software that monitors and regulates network traffic, basing its actions on pre-set security rules. A firewall can stop potentially hazardous traffic from entering the system and can stop unauthorized users from accessing the network."
"The use of encryption is yet another crucial component of network security. Data is transformed into a secret code via encryption to prevent unauthorized access. Sensitive information, like passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data, is frequently secured via encryption."
"Network security also entails the deployment of antivirus and anti-malware software in addition to firewalls and encryption. These tools are made to identify and eliminate dangerous software from the network, such as Trojan horses, worms, and viruses. Anti-malware software is essential for preventing hackers from breaking into networks or stealing critical data."
"Strong password implementation and access control procedures are also necessary for network security. Access control methods ensure that only authorized users are allowed access to particular regions of the network, and strong passwords are crucial in preventing unwanted access to the network."
"Monitoring and analyzing network traffic on a regular basis is another essential component of network security. Network managers must keep an eye on network traffic for any unusually high volumes of traffic or traffic coming from unidentified sources, among other signs of suspicious activity. Network traffic analysis can be used to identify and stop attacks before they harm the network."
"Finally, maintaining network security also entails patching and updating network hardware and software on a regular basis. To keep network hardware and software secure against known flaws and attacks, network managers must often upgrade and patch them."
"Finally, network security is an important component of network systems. It entails using firewalls, encryption, antivirus and anti-malware software, strong passwords, access control measures, routine network traffic monitoring and analysis, and regular network device and software upgrades and patches. Network administrators can defend the network against different assaults and guarantee the integrity and safety of the network and its data by putting these security measures in place."
"Protecting sensitive information and computer systems from online threats requires both network security and information security. Despite their near resemblance, the two have some variances. The following are some important distinctions between network security and information security:"
"While information security and network security are intertwined, they concentrate on separate facets of protecting computer systems and data. Information security is primarily concerned with securing the data that lives on networks, whereas network security is more concerned with safeguarding the network architecture. Both are crucial for defending against online dangers and guaranteeing the privacy, accuracy, and accessibility of sensitive data."
"To safeguard sensitive data, computer systems, and networks, information security and network security are two key components of cybersecurity. Following are some examples of how network security and information security are used:"
Confidentiality: Information security ensures that sensitive information is kept confidential and not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
"Integrity: Information security guarantees that data is accurate, complete, and reliable, and that it has not been altered or modified in any way."
Availability: Information security makes sure that data is available when needed and that it can be accessed by authorized users.
Authentication: Information security uses authentication methods to verify the identity of users and ensure that they are authorized to access sensitive information.
Authorization: Information security controls access to sensitive information and resources to ensure that only authorized individuals can access them.
"Non-repudiation: Information security ensures that the origin and authenticity of data can be verified, so that users cannot deny sending or receiving certain data."
Firewall: Network security uses firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to networks and protect them from external threats.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Network security uses IDS to detect and respond to intrusions and attacks on networks.
"Virtual Private Network (VPN): Network security uses VPN to create secure connections between remote users and networks, ensuring that data is transmitted securely and confidentially."
Encryption: Network security uses encryption to protect sensitive data and prevent it from being intercepted and read by unauthorized users.
"Network Access Control (NAC): Network security uses NAC to control access to networks and resources, ensuring that only authorized users can access them."
Antivirus software: Network security uses antivirus software to detect and remove malware and other malicious programs from networks and devices.
These are but a few of the numerous uses for network and information security. Individuals and organizations can safeguard their confidential information and computer systems from online threats and attacks by putting these security measures in place.
"In today's digital age, network systems are integral to the functioning of businesses, organizations, and even individuals. From internet connectivity to cloud services, network systems are essential to communication, collaboration, and data sharing. However, with the benefits of network systems come significant security risks. The role of a security engineer in network systems is to mitigate these risks by designing, implementing, and maintaining secure network infrastructures."
"A security engineer in network systems is responsible for identifying potential security risks, such as unauthorized access, malware attacks, and data breaches. They work to prevent these risks by designing and implementing security solutions that protect network infrastructure, devices, and data. These solutions may include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption protocols, and access controls. Additionally, they perform regular vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security threats before they can be exploited."
"One of the primary responsibilities of a security engineer in network systems is to design and implement secure network architectures. This involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in the network and designing solutions that address those vulnerabilities. They must also ensure that network components, such as routers, switches, and servers, are configured correctly to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data."
"Another critical responsibility of a security engineer in network systems is to monitor network activity for potential security threats. They use network monitoring tools to identify anomalies in network traffic and investigate any suspicious activity. They also perform incident response procedures to contain and mitigate security incidents, such as malware infections or data breaches."
"In addition to designing and implementing security solutions, a security engineer in network systems must also stay up-to-date with the latest security threats and trends. They attend industry conferences, participate in training programs, and read security publications to stay informed about emerging threats and technologies. They also collaborate with other members of the IT team to ensure that security measures are integrated into all aspects of the network infrastructure."
"Finally, a security engineer in network systems must be able to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. They must be able to explain complex security concepts in simple terms and work with other departments, such as HR or legal, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."
"In conclusion, the role of a security engineer in network systems is critical to maintaining the security and integrity of network infrastructure. They are responsible for identifying potential security risks, designing and implementing security solutions, monitoring network activity, and staying up-to-date with the latest security threats and trends. Their work ensures that organizations can leverage the benefits of network systems while minimizing the risks associated with them."
"As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and reliant on technology, the role of a security architect in network systems has become more important than ever. A security architect is responsible for designing and implementing security measures to protect a network system from cyber threats, including hacking, malware, and data breaches. In this article, we will explore the role of a security architect in network systems and the skills required to succeed in this position."
"A security architect is responsible for designing, developing, and implementing security solutions for network systems. They work closely with other IT professionals, including network engineers, software developers, and system administrators, to ensure that the network is secure from internal and external threats."
"The security architect is responsible for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the network and developing strategies to mitigate them. This may involve developing security protocols, implementing encryption technologies, and designing firewalls and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the network."
The security architect is also responsible for monitoring the network for security breaches and responding to incidents as they occur. They may work with law enforcement or other security professionals to investigate and track down cybercriminals who attempt to breach the network.
"To succeed as a security architect in network systems, you will need a combination of technical and soft skills. Here are some of the key skills that you should possess:"

This article will provide lots of advantages and disadvantages of conventional testing. Before moving on to the advantages and disadvantages let's first understand what is conventional testing.
"The traditional method of software testing, which comprises the creation and execution of a number of test cases to ensure that a software programme satisfies its requirements and performs as intended, is frequently referred to as ""conventional testing""."
"In conventional testing, test cases are often created using the requirements specification or user stories, and testers manually run them to find errors or faults in the product. A few of the testing phases that are frequently used in the process are acceptance testing, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Each phase of the testing process verifies a distinct part of the software."
"With a focus on the preparation, documentation, and traceability of test cases, conventional testing frequently comprises a clearly defined testing procedure. However, especially for complicated software programs, it can be time-consuming and expensive, and it might not find every flaw or issue. Since test automation and agile testing are intended to increase the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of software testing, many organizations have adopted these more contemporary testing techniques."
"Automated testing has grown in popularity recently and can be a more effective and trustworthy alternative to traditional testing. Using software tools, predefined test cases are executed during automated testing, and the results are compared to what was anticipated."
"Overall, conventional testing is still a crucial component of the software development lifecycle and is used to make sure that the final products are high-quality, dependable, and match user needs."
"Structured approach: Conventional testing is conducted in accordance with a predetermined set of guidelines, test plans, and test cases, all of which offer a deliberate and systematic approach to testing. By doing this, it is certain that the program has been thoroughly tested and is available with all features and functions."
Human intuition: Humans have a natural ability to sense problems that automated testing technologies can miss. Manual testers can find flaws that might otherwise go undetected by applying their knowledge and intuition.
"Easy to understand: Conventional testing can be easily understood by testers and developers, as it involves following a set of predefined steps and criteria. This makes it simpler to organize experiments, carry them out, and inform the team's other members of the findings."
"Manual and automated testing: Conventional testing can be carried out manually or automatically using testing tools, giving the testing process flexibility. The advantages of manual and automated testing can thus be balanced."
"Cost-effectiveness: It can be a profitable testing strategy to use because it does not require a significant investment in testing technologies or equipment. Due to this, it is now accessible to both large organizations and small and medium-sized businesses."
"Flexibility: Because manual testers can quickly respond to changes in requirements and modify their test cases as necessary, manual testing gives greater flexibility in terms of the sorts of tests that may be run."
Ensures software quality: conventional testing ensures that software meets the defined quality standards and criteria. It assists with identifying and fixing issues and flaws before the application is made available to end users.
"Reduces risk: Traditional testing aids in the reduction of the risk of software failures or flaws, which may be costly or harmful to a company."
"Limited scalability: Because managing and running a large number of test cases can be challenging, conventional testing may not be scalable for large or complicated software projects."
"Limited scope: Traditional testing is restricted to specified test cases, which might not cover all potential scenarios or use cases. This may cause the software to have bugs or other problems that have not yet been found."
"Error-prone: Manual testing can be error-prone as it relies on the accuracy and consistency of human testers. Testers may miss some defects or make errors in the testing process, which can lead to quality issues."
"Not always successful: Traditional testing may not always be successful in locating all faults in the product. To ensure thorough testing of the software, extra procedures or methods can be needed."
"Time-consuming: Manual testing can be time-consuming, especially for larger applications. Testing each functionality manually can take a lot of time, which can delay the overall project delivery."
"Difficult to replicate real-world scenarios: Real-world events are challenging to recreate, and this might lead to defects or other problems in the program that are not usually found via conventional testing."
A network authentication protocol called Kerberos is used to offer safe communication over insecure networks. It was created at MIT in the 1980s and is currently utilised extensively across many computer networks.
"A ""ticket-granting ticket"" (TGT) system is used by the Kerberos protocol to authenticate users and provide them access to network resources. A user receives a TGT when they log in, which they can use to request tickets for particular network services. Only the Kerberos authentication server is capable of decrypting the TGT due to its encryption."
"Kerberos also uses symmetric-key cryptography to secure communication between network services. This means that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages, which makes it more efficient than other encryption methods."
"Basically, Kerberos provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users and protect network resources from unauthorized access."
"As we all know Kerberos is based on a client-server model, where the client requests access to a network resource and the server grants or denies access based on the user's authentication credentials."
Following is the list of general steps involved in how Kerberos works:
"Request for Authentication: The client contacts the Kerberos authentication server with a request for a ""ticket-granting ticket"" (TGT)."
TGT Issuance: The Kerberos authentication server issues a TGT if the client's authentication credentials are legitimate. This TGT contains a secret key that is known only to the client and server. The secret key of the server is used to encrypt this TGT.
TGS Request: The client then submits a request for a ticket to access a particular network resource to the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS). The TGT obtained in step 2 and the network resource the client wishes to access are both included in this request.
TGS Reaction: The TGS unlocks the TGT and confirms the client's identity. The TGS issues a ticket to the client for the requested network if authentication is successful. This ticket includes a new session key that is used to encrypt communication between the client and the network resource.
Resource Access: The client uses the ticket and session key to access the network resource. The resource decrypts the ticket using the TGS's secret key to verify that it is valid and grants or denies access based on the client's authentication credentials.
Renewal: The client can renew its TGT and ticket for a network resource periodically to continue accessing network resources.
"Basically we can say that Kerberos uses combination of secrets keys, encrypted tickets and authentication servers to provide secure authentication and access control for network resources."
There are several advantages of using the Kerberos authentication protocol in a network environment:
"Strong Security: Kerberos uses strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and other security threats. It provides end-to-end encryption between the client and the server, ensuring that communication is secure even over non-trusted networks."
"Centralized Authentication: Kerberos provides a centralized authentication system, which simplifies user authentication and reduces the risk of password fatigue or reuse. Users only need to authenticate once to gain access to multiple network resources, reducing the burden of remembering and managing multiple passwords."
"Scalability: Kerberos is highly scalable and can handle large user populations, making it ideal for enterprise environments. It can also be integrated with existing identity and access management systems, enabling organizations to leverage their existing infrastructure."
Interoperability: Kerberos is an industry-standard protocol and is supported by a wide range of operating systems and network applications. This enables interoperability between different systems and simplifies the integration of new applications into existing environments.
"Flexibility: Kerberos supports a wide range of authentication methods; including passwords, smart cards, and biometric authentication, providing flexibility to meet the needs of different users and organizations."
There are some disadvantages of Kerberos. Some of them are as follows:
"Complexity: Setting up and configuring Kerberos can be challenging and call for advanced technical skills. It may be more challenging to manage and troubleshoot because to this complexity, especially for smaller firms with constrained IT resources."
"Single Point of Failure: To manage authentication credentials and issue tickets, Kerberos depends on a central authentication server. This server could be the source of a system-wide outage or security breach if it crashes or is exploited."
"Limited Support for Non-Windows Systems: Kerberos is an industry-standard protocol, but it may not be completely supported by all non-Windows systems. This may hinder the integration of various systems and applications and cause interoperability problems."
"Possibility for misuse: The security of the entire system may be jeopardised if Kerberos tickets or authentication credentials are lost, stolen, or used improperly."
"LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. A distributed directory service, such as a directory of users, computers, printers, and other network tools, can be accessed and managed using the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) protocol. The X.500 directory access protocol, which was more complicated and resource-intensive, was replaced by LDAP, which was intended to be a lighter option."
"Based on a client-server architecture, LDAP allows clients to submit requests to servers and receive responses containing directory data in return. Each node in the hierarchical tree structure representing an item in the directory, such as a user, group, or organisational unit, is made up of directory information."
"Addition, deletion, and modification of directory entries are just a few of the operations that LDAP allows for accessing and changing directory data. Additionally, it offers a flexible search function that enables users to look for directory listings based on particular parameters like name, email address, or group membership."
"In corporate settings, LDAP is frequently used to manage user and group data as well as authentication and authorization. Numerous directory service products, such as Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and Novell eDirectory, enable it."
"As we all know that LDAP works on the client server model. Clients connect to an LDAP server and send requests for directory information, and the server responds with the requested information."
"Authentication: The client connects to the LDAP server and supplies login information, such as an identity and password. If the passwords are legitimate, the server validates them and allows the client access."
"Search: The client submits a search request to the server with the name, email address, or other details of the desired directory entry as the search parameters."
"Directory Lookup: Using the search criteria, the server searches the directory for the requested information and provides the client with a list of items that match the search criteria."
"Data Retrieval: The client obtains directory information such as a user's identity, email address, or membership in a group from the server."
"Modify: The client can also modify directory information by sending a modify request to the server, specifying the changes to be made. The server verifies the changes and updates the directory accordingly."
"In LDAP, each directory entry is arranged into a tree of nodes or objects, which is built on a hierarchical tree structure. Each node can have one or more offspring nodes, and the root node is the highest level node in the tree. It is simple to search, retrieve, and change directory information because of how the entries are organised."
LDAP provides several advantages that we can use for organization for managing directory information and authentication:
"Centralized management: LDAP enables organisations to manage directory information, such as user and group information, across numerous systems and applications from a single location. This makes it simpler to enforce security standards and manage resource access."
"Scalability: To accommodate big directory services with millions of entries, LDAP is built to scale. Because of this, it can be used in large enterprise settings where scalability is essential."
"Interoperability: Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and Novell eDirectory are just a few directory services and applications that support the standardised LDAP protocol. This makes it simple to include several programmes and systems into a single directory service."
"Access control: Based on user roles, groups, or other criteria, businesses can restrict access to directory information and resources using the versatile access control mechanism offered by LDAP."
"Efficient searching: Searching is speedy and precise because to LDAP's very effective search system, which enables users to look up directory information based on particular criteria like name, email address, or group membership."
"Although the phrases ""cybersecurity"" and ""information security"" are sometimes used interchangeably, they really have different meanings. Both are necessary to safeguard sensitive information and systems, but they concentrate on various facets of security. In this post, we will examine the distinctions between information security and cybersecurity and explain why both are essential for safeguarding digital assets."
"Cybersecurity is the process of preventing unwanted access, theft, damage, or exploitation of computer systems, networks, and devices. Protecting digital assets from external dangers including viruses, malware, and hacking attempts is the focus of cybersecurity."
"Cybersecurity experts utilize a range of methods, including as firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and encryption, to safeguard digital assets. They also employ vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to find and fix system flaws before attackers can take advantage of them."
"Because cyberattacks are getting more frequent and sophisticated, cybersecurity is crucial. It's up to cybersecurity experts to remain ahead of hackers, who are continually coming up with new ways to access networks and steal important data."
"On the other side, information security is the process of ensuring the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information. Information security is concerned with safeguarding data in any type, including digital and physical."
"Data protection, access management, and disaster recovery are only a few of the many subjects covered by information security. Information security experts utilize a range of methods, including as encryption, password rules, and access control systems, to safeguard sensitive data."
"Information security is crucial since data breaches can result in major negative effects, such as monetary losses, reputational harm, and legal responsibility. A data leak may occasionally even endanger lives."
"Cybersecurity and information security are fundamentally different in that the former focuses on safeguarding digital assets from external threats while the latter protects data in any format. Protecting computer systems, networks, and gadgets from unwanted access, theft, damage, or exploitation is the focus of cybersecurity. Whether the information is digital or physical, information security is concerned with preserving its availability, confidentiality, and integrity."
"Information security and cybersecurity are both essential for safeguarding digital assets. Information security defends against internal hazards like human mistake and neglect, whereas cybersecurity defends against external threats like hackers and viruses."
"Because cyberattacks and data breaches are growing more frequent and sophisticated, cybersecurity and information security are both crucial. To defend digital assets from attackers, cybersecurity experts must remain abreast of the most recent threats and vulnerabilities. Professionals in information security must make sure that sensitive data is secure, whether it is stored digitally or physically."
"Well, here is a table that compares and contrasts information security with cyber security:"
"To sum up, essential elements of a thorough security programme include both cybersecurity and information security. These may overlap in certain areas, but they each concentrate on a separate component of security, necessitating the use of unique tools and methods to safeguard digital assets and private information. To create successful security plans and defend themselves against cyber attacks, enterprises must fully comprehend the distinctions between the two."
"Facebook created GraphQL, a query language for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It is a more effective substitute for conventional RESTful APIs since it enables clients to just request the data they want from the server."
"With GraphQL, clients may send a query to the server that details exactly what data they want and in what format. The server then sends less information across the network and provides just the data that was requested in a JSON format."
"The flexibility of GraphQL is one of its main benefits. Complex searches with nested fields can be specified by clients, and the server can deliver the needed data in a single answer. Several round trips to the server are no longer necessary, which is a typical problem with RESTful APIs."
"As a query language for APIs, GraphQL has gained popularity and makes it possible for clients and servers to communicate effectively. Unfortunately, it is not impervious to security risks like any other technology. Organizations utilizing GraphQL are increasingly concerned about GraphQL assaults since they can result in the exposing of sensitive data, denial of service attacks, and other nefarious actions. In this post, we'll talk about some typical GraphQL attacks and how to defend against them."
"Injection Attacks: Injection attacks are among the most prevalent GraphQL attack types. An attacker can include malicious code into a GraphQL query and control the server's behavior by taking advantage of flaws in the query. This may lead to the exposing of private information, a denial of service, or even complete server control. It is crucial to sanitize user input and check the input data in order to prevent injection attacks."
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that flood the server with a large number of requests can cause server failures or make GraphQL APIs unusable. Attackers may take advantage of poorly worded queries to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Server-side throttling systems and query complexity restrictions must be put in place to stop DoS attacks.
"Authorization and Authentication Attacks: Attacks on authorization and authentication can happen when a hacker gets past the security system and accesses information they are not allowed to see. For instance, attackers may get access to user data by abusing improperly configured authentication systems, exposing sensitive data. To stop such attacks, it's crucial to create strong authentication procedures."
"Information Disclosure Attacks: When a hacker uses GraphQL queries to obtain private data about the server, database, or other resources, this is known as an information disclosure attack. Information disclosure attacks may result from improperly built GraphQL endpoints that offer excessive information. Access to sensitive information should be controlled, and restrictions on query complexity should be imposed to prevent information disclosure threats."
"Schema Manipulation Attacks: Attackers that modify the GraphQL schema to obtain unauthorized access to data or functionality are known as ""schema manipulation attacks."" Attackers can, for instance, implement a new query that gives them the ability to access sensitive data without being authenticated. Server-side schema validation measures must be put in place to stop schema manipulation attacks."
"Since it allows for effective communication between clients and servers, GraphQL has grown in popularity as a platform for creating APIs. Security has become a top worry for corporations, though, since GraphQL is being adopted more widely."
Input Validation: Input validation is one of the most significant security techniques. Attackers can utilize GraphQL queries' weaknesses to run malicious code because they are user-generated. It's crucial to validate user input by defining input types and enforcing them on the server-side in order to avoid this.
Query Complexity Limits: Complex and nested GraphQL queries might cause excessive resource usage and slow the server down. Attackers may take advantage of poorly crafted queries to launch DoS attacks by using an excessive amount of resources. Limits on query complexity must be implemented on the server side to avoid this.
"Authentication and Authorization: To stop unauthorized access to sensitive data, authentication and permission procedures must be put in place. To guarantee that only authorized users may access sensitive data, it is crucial to authenticate users before enabling them to perform queries and to enforce permission rules."
"Rate Limiting: By restricting the number of queries a user may run in a specific amount of time, rate limiting can avoid the excessive usage of resources. This can stop DoS attacks and guarantee equitable resource utilization."
"Use HTTPS: The information exchanged between the client and the server should be encrypted using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). By doing this, eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks that jeopardize data privacy may be avoided."
"Schema Validation: When an attacker updates the GraphQL schema to obtain unauthorized access to data or functionality, schema validation can stop the attack. To stop assaults on schema manipulation, server-side schema validation methods must be put in place."
"Regular Security Audits: To find and quickly fix any vulnerabilities in the GraphQL implementation, regular security audits should be carried out."
"In order to prevent security breaches and data theft, GraphQL must be secured in network systems. Organizations may reduce the risk of attacks and maintain the security of their APIs and data by adhering to these best practises. To ensure a solid and safe GraphQL implementation, it's also crucial to keep up with the most recent security developments and put those trends into practise."

This article will help you in providing a good understanding of the seven layers of IT security. Before moving on to the main topic first let us know what are IT security layers.
"IT security layers refer to the several levels of security controls that may be used to defend against online attacks. As we know, there are many other alternatives, but the ""defence in depth"" paradigm is a typical framework for layering cybersecurity measures. To provide a more thorough and effective defence against cyber-attacks, this concept entails putting in place many layers of security measures."
There are seven layers of IT security that are mentioned and explained below:
Let us understand each layer from the bottom to the top manner.
"Humans alone are responsible for 90% of data breaches, making them the weakest link in any cyber security strategy. Human security includes the following measures:"
"Access management guidelines which controls the mission-critical assets from a range of human threats,"
"Security Plan: The greatest approaches to keep the human layer safe comes under the education and training. This includes guidelines on how to spot and respond to phishing attempts, strong password techniques, system hardening, and cyber security awareness."
Access restriction is a good idea for safeguarding the human layer since they can lessen the potential damage from a successful assault.
"The perimeter security controls have digital and physical security measures that protect the entire business. When identifying the type of data being transferred across this layer, we must first determine our perimeter. After that, we must secure both data and the device."
"Security Plan: Installation of firewalls, data encryption, antivirus software, and device management are the security strategies which are crucial when a company allows their employees to use their own device. This layer also establish a safe demilitarised zone to enhance security."
There are various methods of network security used to protect a company's network and helps in preventing unauthorized access. The main concern with the network layer is what people and devices may access once they are on a network. Network Security methods/techniques are mainly used to protect the important data of an organization from network attacks.
"Security Plan: If no individual has access to everything, then any successful hack only compromises a tiny piece of the network. At this stage, the security measures only allow the devices and workers to access only those network resources that are essential for them to perform their tasks."
"Any device that is linked to your network is referred to as an endpoint. As we mentioned above, there are so many endpoints on networks nowadays that it may be a bit daunting. To manage and monitor these devices, it is crucial to present the robust policy."
"Security Plan: At this level, encryption is essential, but it can't merely apply to your data. To make sure that the devices themselves are operating in safe settings, endpoint encryption must be installed.  A crucial component of endpoint security is mobile device management (MDM). MDM is a system which give permissions to access the devices remotely, with this it also lets you to restrict access to some networked devices, which is excellent feature. You may use this capability to lock down mobile devices and erase all of their data to prevent from future damage."
"This layer of IT security covers all the programs and applications which are using by the user. Various programs like Microsoft Office, Teams, Zoom, and others, which performs our daily tasks would be secured."
"Security Plan: In this situation, the simplest thing you can do to update your programs or applications regularly. Due to this, it is possible to secure and safe the application and also helps in ensuring that the existing security flaws are fixed."
"In this stage, the security measures will use sandboxes for browser-based applications and the software restriction guidelines to prevent the unauthorised software which is being executed on your network. Along with this, we can safe the things by using the next-generation firewalls which are working with the integrated app protection."
"Cybercriminals mainly target the data in almost every instance. This layer mainly deals with providing high security to the data. As, the data is considered as heart and soul for a business."
"Your company's specific needs will determine the type of data you have, but it may include customer information, payment information, social security numbers, trade secrets (and other intellectual property), and healthcare data."
"Security Plan: At this stage, file and disc encryption, regular backups of all crucial data and operations, two-factor authentication, enterprise rights management, and policies are ensuring that data is deleted from inactive devices or that are being given to another person for use."
"Anything without which your company cannot thrive is listed here. This covers operating systems, cloud infrastructure, software tools, and electronic health records. The difficulty at this layer is that what is crucial for one business may not be crucial for yours. To secure your business, you must first identify the essential elements of it."
"Security Plan: In this level, you have to decide the important apsects to your business."
"This article will help you in providing a detailed explanation of Ad hoc TCP. Before knowing about the Ad hoc TCP model, it is important to learn about Ad hoc networks."
"A wireless ad hoc network (WANET) is a sort of local area network (LAN) that is constructed on the spot to allow the connection of two or more wireless devices without the need for standard network infrastructure equipment, such as a wireless router or access point."
"Ad hoc TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a variant of TCP that is utilized in ad hoc networks. It is a particular kind of TCP that was created with ad hoc networks in mind. Similar to standard TCP, ad hoc TCP also has extra features and capabilities that are specifically made to address the special difficulties of ad hoc networks. Without relying on a pre-existing infrastructure, it enables the dependable communication between devices in these networks."
"The frequent changes in the network topology are one of the main difficulties with ad hoc networks. Network connection difficulties might result from devices moving, shifting positions, or leaving the range of the network."
"It employs a range of approaches to address packet loss, congestion, and other potential problems in a wireless network."
"Network topology changes: Ad hoc networks are dynamic by nature, because they can join the devices and leave the network and move throughout the network. This results in changes to the topology of the network. Due to frequent modification in the network topology, packet loss and delay may result. To keep a connection that is dependable and effective, Ad hoc TCP has to be able to swiftly adjust to these changes."
Limited bandwidth: It can be difficult for ad hoc TCP to function in ad hoc networks as they frequently have constrained bandwidth. Along with this the protocol must be able to utilize the available bandwidth effectively.
"Interference: Other wireless devices can interfere with wireless networks, which can result in packet loss and delay. Ad hoc TCP must be able to recognize and recover from packet loss brought on by interference."
"Security: Due to their wireless nature, ad hoc networks are intrinsically less secure than conventional networks. Ad hoc TCP must be capable of providing secure communication in the face of malicious actor attacks."
"Scalability: With so many devices in ad hoc networks, it might be challenging to control network traffic and guarantee a dependable connection. Ad hoc TCP must be scalable to accommodate huge networks while preserving effective communication."
The characteristics or features of Ad hoc TCP are discussed below:
Reliable and efficient transport: Ad hoc TCP is intended to offer dependable and effective data packet transmission across the wireless channel. Data packets are reliably and effectively transferred using strategies like congestion control and error recovery.
"Decentralized Routing: Ad hoc networks often manage network routing using a decentralized routing protocol such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) or Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). This enables network devices to identify and communicate with one another in real time, without the requirement for a pre-existing network infrastructure."
"Support for multimedia traffic: Ad hoc TCP is intended to handle a variety of multimedia traffic, including real-time voice and video streams. It employs techniques like prioritization and buffering to ensure that multimedia traffic is reliably and effectively transmitted."
Dynamic topology: Ad hoc networks feature a dynamic topology where nodes can migrate often and the network topology can change quickly. Ad hoc TCP must be able to adjust to these modifications and keep solid end-to-end connections.
"Distributed Control: Ad hoc networks do not have a central authority that controls the network. Instead, nodes must work together to ensure reliable communication. Ad hoc TCP must control and coordinate the data transfer among the nodes in the network."
Energy Efficiency: Ad hoc TCP must preserve energy in the network since many ad hoc networks are powered by batteries. It does this by minimizing the number of transmissions and the quantity of data that has to be transferred.
"Ad hoc TCP functions similarly to traditional TCP, but with modifications there are some difficulties exist in the ad hoc networks. Ad hoc TCP incorporates strategies to deal with mobility, low bandwidth, high packet loss rates, energy efficiency, and changing topology. This network also offers reliable end-to-end communication between nodes in the network."
"Connection Establishment: When a node in the network needs to connect with another node, Ad hoc TCP starts its process with the connection setup. The destination node responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet after receiving a SYN (synchronise) packet from the sending node. When the initiating node replies with an ACK (acknowledge) packet to the SYN-ACK packet, the connection is established."
Data Transfer: The nodes can exchange data after their link is established. The underlying ad hoc routing protocol is used by ad hoc TCP to divide the data into packets and deliver them over the network. Ad hoc TCP uses flow control techniques to make sure the receiving node can manage the data transmission rate.
"Congestion Control: Congestion control techniques are applied by ad hoc TCP to avoid network congestion and guarantee reliable communication. Congestion avoidance, detection, and slow-start are some of these strategies."
"Packet Loss Recovery: Ad hoc TCP uses packet loss recovery algorithms for providing the effective exchange of data. These procedures include selective acknowledgement (SACK) of received packets, quick retransmission of duplicate ACKs, and retransmission of lost packets."
"Connection Termination: A node finishes its process by sending a FIN (finish) message to stop a connection to the other node. To acknowledge the termination request, the other node replies with an ACK packet. Once both nodes have exchanged FIN and ACK packets, the connection is officially closed."
This is all about the ad hoc TCP with its features and functioning. Ad hoc TCP model helps in providing reliable communication between the existing nodes in ad hoc networks.
"This article will provide a detailed explanation of the topic called Server Name Indication(SNI). Before moving on to the main topic first, let us understand what is the server name."
A server name is just a computer's name. Users are not shown this name in the case of web servers unless the server only hosts one domain and its name is the same as the domain name. The clients provide that hostname by which they can connect at the before handshaking using the Server Name Indication feature of the Transport Layer Security computer networking protocol.
"Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension of the TLS protocol. At the beginning of the TLS handshake, a client or browser is permitted to specify the hostname through which he/she can connect. With the same IP address and port, the server may thus show a number of certificates. Before SNI, only one SSL/TLS certificate could be issued per IP address, making it impossible to run several secure websites on the same server."
"IP addresses are very deficient sources i.e., they are available in very less number. So, SNI helps in protecting these IP addresses."
Some other important reasons of using SNI are mentioned below:
website that requires SSL/TLS encryption need not require to set up a separate IP address by using SNI.
SNI makes the connection simpler for website administrators and owners to maintain SSL/TLS certificates.
SNI enables servers to host several TLS certificates for numerous sites under a single IP address.
"SNI offers the benefit of hiding the certificate from scanning, which helps to boost security."
"The ""ClientHello"" message is sent by the client to the server as part of a TLS handshake."
"The hostname of the server that the client wants to connect is included in the ""ClientHello"" message."
"The requested hostname's SSL/TLS certificate is included in the ""ServerHello"" message which the server sends back as a response."
The server will respond with an error message and cut off the connection if it doesn't support SNI or doesn't have a certificate for the requested hostname.
The client and server will finish the TLS handshake and start the encrypted connection if the server has a valid SSL/TLS certificate for the specified hostname.
"Modern web browsers and servers, like Apache and Nginx, support SNI to a large extent. SNI may not be supported by older servers and browsers, which might cause compatibility problems."
Following are the some features or characteristics of Server Name Identification:
"Cost Savings: IP addresses are very expensive to obtain and use. SNI helps in reducing the need for additional IP addresses for hosting multiple websites. So, lots of money can be saved as the there is no necessity for additional IP addresses."
Compatibility: SNI is a widely used technique for hosting several secure websites on a single server because the majority of modern web browsers and servers support it.
"Multiple certificates: In order to host many domain names on the same IP address, SNI permits the installation of numerous SSL/TLS certificates on a single server."
"Improved Performance: SNI lets the servers to handle more requests and make better use of their resources, which can speed up websites."
"Enhanced Security: In order to improve security and fend against man-in-the-middle attacks, SNI makes sure that the appropriate SSL/TLS certificate is being utilised for each domain name."
"Flexibility: SNI offers flexibility by hosting multiple domains i.e., SNI allows a single server to host different websites where each having its OWN SSL/TLS certificate."
Better resource utilization: The main benefit of using SNI is that it allows several SSL certificates to be hosted on a single IP address. This will help in eliminating waste and maximizing resource efficiency.
Simplified management: The Server Name Identification minimizes the complexity of SSL certificate administration which allows many SSL certificates to be hosted on a single IP address.
"Support for virtual hosting: The cost of hosting SSL certificates is further decreased because of SNI's compatibility with virtual hosting.
Virtual hosting is the process of running several websites on a single server, allowing different domains to share server resources like CPU, memory, and storage. Virtual hosting also allows website owners to host numerous websites on a single physical server which eliminates the need for additional servers and helps in reducing the cost."
Improved Server Efficiency: Server Name Identification increases the server efficiency by reducing the number of IP addresses required for SSL certificates.
"With the benefits of SNI, it also has some limitations which are discussed below:"
"Limited to HTTPS: Server Name Identification is only used for HTTPS connections. So, it has no advantages over other protocols like FTP or SMTP."
"Lack of Encrypted SNI Support: The information of Server Name Identification is transmitted in plain text during the TLS handshake, which makes it possible for third parties to view the domain name of the website being accessed. To overcome this limitation, we can use the encrypted SNI, but it is not supported by many systems."
"Complexity: Server Name Identification increases the complexity of the SSL/TLS negotiation process, which might lead to more setup mistakes or SSL certificate management mistakes."
"Performance: SNI may add additional round trips between the client and server, which may increase latency and reduce the performance."
Single Certificate Per IP Address: The main disadvantage of SNI is that it uses single certificate for one IP address. This can create a problem if many websites are hosted on the same IP address under different certificates.

"Bluetooth is a generation that nearly every device is in use these days, it turned into the most famous and safe way of sharing statistics in the early times. Bluetooth uses a brief-range wi-fi generation that is used for changing data among constant and cell devices over quick distances and constructing non-public location networks. Bluetooth holds a transmission restriction of up to 2.Five milliwatts, the reason for its short-range transmission."
The country of any given Bluetooth unit (having a required strength delivery) can broadly be labeled as standby or connection. A tool in standby state is not lively in any network. A Bluetooth-enabled tool within the connection nation is synchronized to a piconet. Such a device may be in one of the following 4 modes:
"The Sniff mode on devices has the highest responsibility cycle of the three power-saving modes or the least power efficiency. By decreasing the responsibility cycle, or growing the listening c program language period, power efficiency is attained."
A Slave enters sniff mode through receiving a sniff command message at the LMP degree from both the Master or another slave.
The programmable sniff c program language period parameter Tsniff is found in this message. Sniff periods can last for a few seconds or longer.
"When there may be a known long communique lag between the slave and the master, sniff mode is appropriate."
"However, there may be no assurance that devices will acquire protection at every c language."
Sniff mode might be useful for extending battery lifestyles by means of minimizing ballot packet transmission which isn't important.
"When in Active mode, a Bluetooth device actively participates inside the piconet by sending and receiving records/managing packets. In order to differentiate among energetic Slaves and parked contributors, every energetic Slave in a piconet is given a distinct three-bit AM_ADDR (Active Member copes with)."
"The MAC deal with AM_ADDR, stays valid so long as the Slave is engaged within the channel."
"A Master can cope with a particular Slave via the use of values between 001 and 111 inside the AM_ADDR variable, or it can broadcast a message to all Slaves by using the fee 000."
"When sending packets to the Master, a Slave consists of its own AM_ADDR, enabling the Master to understand the Slave."
"In addition to ordinary transmissions, the Master schedules statistics transmission based on site visitors' demands to and from diverse Slaves to maintain Slaves synchronized with the channel."
An energetic slave most effectively transmits within the strange-numbered Slave-to-Master slots and listens for packets within the even-numbered Master-to-Slave slots.
An energetic Slave may work to sleep (one of the strength-saving modes) if it isn't addressed until the following Master transmission.
"It ought to be stated that, in step with the most recent Bluetooth specification, AM_ADDR determines the most variety of active Slaves in a piconet to be 7."
The closing three modes reduce their duty cycle during the Connection nation on the way to preserve power.
"When a slave comes to a decision to remain inactive within the piconet for a period of time that is relatively longer than the Sniff and Hold intervals, it enters Park mode. The tool maintains its synchronization inside the piconet while last uninvolved in the traffic. In order to re-synchronize, parked gadgets give up their MAC (AM_ADDR address) and sometimes pay attention to broadcast messages from the grasp. Of the three strength-saving modes, it offers the highest power efficiency."
"Devices that occasionally want to communicate with a Master can be accommodated in park mode. Following a periodic beacon despatched by means of the Master, a Slave exits Park mode through sending a packet to the Master requesting a transition from Park to Active mode. The beacon interval is programmable. Since parked members give up their MAC addresses, each of them is given two extra addresses to assist Master preserve tune of them."
"PM_ADDR: Parked Member Address is an 8-bit lengthy Master-neighborhood deal used for the identification of parked slaves. The PM_ADDR is legitimate so long as the slave is parked. PM_ADDR being eight-bits lengthy, allows as many as 256 devices to exist concurrently in Park mode in an unmarried piconet."
AR_ADDR: Access Request Address is likewise an 8-bit long address that is used by parked slaves to decide the Slave-to-Master half of slot within the access window wherein it could transmit an access request
The electricity efficiency of devices in Hold mode is in the middle of the 3 energy-saving modes. The tool is briefly rendered inactive to boost electricity efficiency. Only an internal timer inside the tool is operational during a Hold.
A device can be placed into Hold mode through the Master by using itself or by using the Slave particularly asking the Master to do so.
Both gadgets agree on how lengthy the Slave ought to be in Hold mode before the Hold mode is activated.
"After the unit exits Hold mode, facts switch resumes. When a tool knows there is any conversation for a positive quantity of time, it can input this mode throughout that point for you to serve any other undertaking, together with participating in some other piconet, or to preserve energy."
"A Noisy Channel Protocol is a sort of conversation protocol that is used in communique structures where the transmission channel may additionally introduce mistakes into the transmitted facts. This sort of protocol is designed to cope with mistakes in the communication channel and make sure that the statistics being transmitted are received appropriately when the receiver gives up. The important goal of Noisy Channel Protocols is to minimize the error rate in the transmitted data through techniques including blunders detection and correction, go with the flow manipulation, and retransmission of misplaced or corrupted facts frames. Some examples of Noisy Channel Protocols encompass the Stop-and-Wait Protocol, the Sliding Window Protocol, and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol."
"STOP-AND-WAIT ARQ Protocol - The Stop and Wait protocol is a protocol used for dependable records transmission over a noisy channel. In this protocol, the sender simplest sends one frame at a time and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver earlier than sending the subsequent frame. This facilitates making certain that the receiver gets the data efficiently and gets rid of the want for retransmission within the case of mistakes as a result of the noisy channel. The sender continuously video displays the channel for mistakes, and if a blunders is detected, it waits for the next ACK before resending the body. This protocol adds blunders manipulated to the basic unidirectional communique of statistics frames and ACK frames within the opposite route."
A statistics glide diagram in the Stop-and-Wait protocol in a loud channel may be used to describe the go with the flow of information between the sender and the receiver. This diagram generally includes the following components:
"Sender: The sender sends facts frames one after the other, and waits for a reaction (ACK or NACK) from the receiver before sending the following records body."
"Receiver: The receiver receives the recorded frames and approaches them. If the frame is acquired efficiently, the receiver sends an ACK signal to the sender. If the body is not obtained effectively, the receiver sends a NACK sign to the sender."
"Noisy Channel: The noisy channel is the medium through which the information frames are transmitted from the sender to the receiver. The channel can upload noise to the data frames, resulting in errors and corruption of the information."
Error Detection: The receiver uses errors detection strategies such as checksums to locate errors within the acquired statistics frames.
"Error Correction: If a blunders is detected, the receiver sends a NACK sign to the sender, requesting a retransmission of the body."
"In this protocol, the sender simplest sends one data frame at a time and waits for a response from the receiver before sending the next frame. This ensures that the receiver has enough time to system each frame before receiving the subsequent one. The Stop-and-Wait protocol is reliable, however has low throughput compared to different protocols."
"2. GO-BACK-N ARQ Protocol - The Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol is a form of error-manipulate protocol used in data verbal exchange to ensure reliable delivery of records over a loud channel. In a noisy channel, the possibility of mistakes inside the obtained packets is excessive, and hence, there is a desire for a mechanism to hit upon and accurately identify those errors."
"The Go-Back-N ARQ protocol is a kind of sliding window protocol wherein the sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, and the receiver sends lower back an acknowledgment (ACK) to the sender indicating a receipt of the packets. In case the sender does now not receive an ACK inside a targeted timeout period, it retransmits the whole window of packets."
The waft diagram that illustrates the operation of the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol in a noisy channel:
"The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, starting with series range i and finishing with collection quantity i + N - 1, wherein N is the window length."
The sender sets a timer for each packet inside the window.
The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.
"If a packet is acquired successfully, the receiver sends an ACK returned to the sender with the collection range of the subsequent predicted packet."
"If a packet is obtained with errors, the receiver discards the packet and sends a poor acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender with the series variety of the following predicted packet."
"If the sender does not receive an ACK earlier than the timer for a packet expires, the sender retransmits the entire window of packets beginning with the packet whose timer expired."
The sender resets the timer for every packet within the window.
"If the sender receives a NAK from the receiver, the sender retransmits the packets that have not been effectively received through the receiver."
The sender resets the timer for each packet that was retransmitted.
The above steps are repeated till all packets have been correctly obtained with the aid of the receiver. The Go-Back-N ARQ protocol provides a dependable mechanism for transmitting information over a noisy channel whilst minimizing the number of retransmissions required.
The above steps are repeated till all packets have been correctly obtained with the aid of the receiver. The Go-Back-N ARQ protocol provides a dependable mechanism for transmitting information over a noisy channel whilst minimizing the number of retransmissions required.
"3. SELECTIVE REPEAT ARQ Protocol - The Selective Repeat ARQ protocol is a sort of mistakes-manipulate protocol utilized in fact communique to ensure reliable delivery of data over a noisy channel. Unlike the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol which retransmits the whole window of packets, the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol retransmits only the packets that had been now not correctly acquired."
"In the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol, the sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, and the receiver sends lower back an acknowledgment (ACK) to the sender indicating a successful receipt of the packets. If the receiver detects any blunders in a packet, it sends a bad acknowledgement (NAK) to the sender requesting retransmission of that packet."
"In the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol, the sender keeps a timer for each packet within the window. If the sender does not get hold of an ACK for a packet before its timer expires, the sender retransmits handiest that packet."
"At the receiver aspect, if a packet is received efficiently, the receiver sends lower back an ACK with the sequence quantity of the following anticipated packet. However, if a packet is obtained with mistakes, the receiver discards the packet and returns a NAK with the sequence variety of the packet that desires to be retransmitted."
"Unlike Go-Back-N ARQ, in Selective Repeat ARQ, the receiver buffer is maintained for all packets that aren't in series. When a packet with a chain quantity exclusive from the predicted collection wide variety arrives at the receiver, it's miles buffered, and the receiver sends an ACK for the final in-order packet it has received."
"If a packet with a series range that the receiver has already buffered arrives, it's far discarded, and the receiver sends an ACK for the closing in-order packet it has obtained."
"In summary, the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol offers a reliable mechanism for transmitting records over a loud channel whilst minimizing the quantity of retransmissions required. It retransmits simplest the packets that had been now not effectively acquired and buffers packets that arrive out of order to reduce the variety of retransmissions required."
The drift diagram that illustrates the operation of the Selective Repeat ARQ protocol in a noisy channel:
"The sender transmits a window of packets to the receiver, starting with sequence number i and ending with series wide variety i + N - 1, where N is the window length."
The sender sets a timer for every packet inside the window.
3. The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.
"If a packet is received effectively and is so as, the receiver sends an ACK lower back to the sender with the sequence quantity of the next predicted packet."
"If a packet is received with errors or is out of order, the receiver discards the packet and sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) to the sender with the series quantity of the packet that desires to be retransmitted."
The receiver buffers out-of-order packets and sends an ACK for the remaining in-order packet it has obtained.
"If the sender gets a NAK from the receiver, the sender retransmits handiest of the packets that were no longer successfully received."
The sender resets the timer for every packet that becomes retransmitted.
"The above steps are repeated till all packets have been successfully obtained through the receiver. The Selective Repeat ARQ protocol provides a dependable mechanism for transmitting statistics over a noisy channel whilst minimizing the range of retransmissions required. It retransmits simplest the packets that have not been efficiently acquired, and buffers out-of-order packets to reduce the wide variety of retransmissions required."
"Density estimation plays a vital function in statistical analysis and device getting to know. It entails estimating the underlying chance density function (PDF) from a given set of facts.

"Control over smoothness: The bandwidth parameter in Parzen Windows lets in for manage over the smoothness of the estimated density. A large bandwidth produces a smoother estimate that may assist in shooting standard traits and lowering noise. On the opposite hand, a smaller bandwidth captures extra detailed variations and local systems inside the facts."
Outlier detection: Parzen Windows may be used for outlier detection by way of identifying regions of low density. Data factors that lie in areas with notably decreased density than the encircling areas may be taken into consideration as potential outliers.
"omputational complexity: As the variety of statistics points will increase, the computational complexity of Parzen Windows grows substantially. For every information point, a kernel wishes to be evaluated for all different information points, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2) for a dataset with n points. This can be computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional areas or with large datasets."
"Bandwidth choice: Choosing the precise bandwidth is vital for correct density estimation with Parzen Windows. However, determining the top-quality bandwidth is not a trivial project and may be hard. A bandwidth that is too huge can over smooth the density and fail to capture neighborhood versions, even as a bandwidth that is too small can result in overfitting and noise amplification."
"Curse of dimensionality: Parzen Windows be afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. As the dimensionality of the information will increase, the amount of information required to gain correct density estimation grows exponentially. This is due to the fact the facts will become sparser in high-dimensional areas, making it tough to estimate densities correctly."
Boundary consequences: Parzen Windows are influenced by means of the boundaries of the facts. The kernel home windows close to the rims of the dataset might not fully capture the density because of factors falling out of doors the variety of the kernel. This can cause biased density estimates near the limits of the records.

A list of top frequently asked networking interview questions and answers are given below
"A network is a set of devices that are connected with a physical media link. In a network, two or more nodes are connected by a physical link or two or more networks are connected by one or more nodes."
A network is a collection of devices connected to each other to allow the sharing of data.
Example of a network is an internet. An internet connects the millions of people across the world.
Network topology specifies the layout of a computer network. It shows how devices and cables are connected to each other. The types of topologies are:
Bus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.
"It acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device wants to send the data to other devices, then it will send the data over the bus which in turn sends the data to all the attached devices."
Bus topology is useful for a small number of devices. As if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.
Star topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as a central device.
"Star topology requires more cable compared to other topologies. Therefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect a specific computer connected to this cable."
"If the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails."
"Star topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot."
Star topology is commonly used in office and home networks.
"Ring topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two or more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission."
It does not need any central server to control the connectivity among the nodes.
"If the single node is damaged, then the whole network fails."
"Ring topology is very rarely used as it is expensive, difficult to install and manage."
"Examples of Ring topology are SONET network, SDH network, etc."
Mesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.
It does not need any central switch or hub to control the connectivity among the nodes.
"Mesh topology is categorized into two parts:

Fully connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other.
Partially connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.

It is a robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer connected to this cable.
Mesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when connectivity gets more.
Cabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring."
"Fully connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other."
"Partially connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other."
It is a robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer connected to this cable.
Mesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when connectivity gets more.
Tree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. It is also known as the expanded star topology.
"In tree topology, all the star networks are connected to a single bus."
"In this, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which can be easily maintained. If one segment is damaged, but there is no effect on other segments."
"Tree topology depends on the ""main bus,"" and if it breaks, then the whole network gets damaged."
A hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form a resulting topology.
"If star topology is connected with another star topology, then it remains star topology. If star topology is connected with different topology, then it becomes a Hybrid topology."
It provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different network environment.
"The weakness of a topology is ignored, and only strength will be taken into consideration."
Network reliability: Network reliability means the ability of the network to carry out the desired operation through a network such as communication through a network.
Network reliability plays a significant role in the network functionality. The network monitoring systems and devices are the essential requirements for making the network reliable.The network monitoring system identifies the problems that are occurred in the network while the network devices ensure that data should reach the appropriate destination.
The reliability of a network can be measured by the following factors:
Downtime: The downtime is defined as the required time to recover.
Failure Frequency: It is the frequency when it fails to work the way it is intended.
"Catastrophe: It indicates that the network has been attacked by some unexpected event such as fire, earthquake."
There are mainly two criteria which make a network effective and efficient:
Performance: : performance can be measured in many ways like transmit time and response time.
Robustness: robustness specifies the quality or condition of being strong and in good condition.
Security: It specifies how to protect data from unauthorized access and viruses.
Every signal has a limit of upper range frequency and lower range frequency. The range of limit of network between its upper and lower frequency is called bandwidth.
"A network is a connection setup of two or more computers directly connected by some physical mediums like optical fiber or coaxial cable. This physical medium of connection is known as a link, and the computers that it is connected are known as nodes."
A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly known as a gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages from one network to another. Both the gateway and router regulate the traffic in the network.
A router sends the data between two similar networks while gateway sends the data between two dissimilar networks.
DNS was introduced by Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.
It is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which includes physical nodes and applications. It is used to locate to resource easily over a network.
DNS is an internet which maps the domain names to their associated IP addresses.
"Without DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you wanted to access."
"If you want to visit the website of ""javaTpoint"", then the user will type ""https://www.javatpoint.com"" into the address bar of the web browser. Once the domain name is entered, then the domain name system will translate the domain name into the IP address which can be easily interpreted by the computer. Using the IP address, the computer can locate the web page requested by the user."
A forwarder is used with DNS server when it receives DNS queries that cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards those requests to external DNS servers for resolution.
A DNS server which is configured as a forwarder will behave differently than the DNS server which is not configured as a forwarder.
"Following are the ways that the DNS server behaves when it is configured as a forwarder:

When the DNS server receives the query, then it resolves the query by using a cache.
If the DNS server is not able to resolve the query, then it forwards the query to another DNS server.
If the forwarder is not available, then it will try to resolve the query by using root hint."
"When the DNS server receives the query, then it resolves the query by using a cache."
"If the DNS server is not able to resolve the query, then it forwards the query to another DNS server."
"If the forwarder is not available, then it will try to resolve the query by using root hint."
NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is a peripheral card attached to the PC to connect to a network. Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the PC on the network.
It provides a wireless connection to a local area network.
"It is used to specify data transfer rate. In 10Base-T, 10 specify the data transfer rate, i.e., 10Mbps. The word Base specifies the baseband as opposed to broadband. T specifies the type of the cable which is a twisted pair."
NOS stands for Network Operating System. It is specialized software which is used to provide network connectivity to a computer to make communication possible with other computers and connected devices.
"NOS is the software which allows the device to communicate, share files with other devices."
"The first network operating system was Novel NetWare released in 1983. Some other examples of NOS are Windows 2000, Windows XP, Linux, etc."
Networks can be divided on the basis of area of distribution. For example:
"PAN (Personal Area Network): Its range limit is up to 10 meters. It is created for personal use. Generally, personal devices are connected to this network. For example computers, telephones, fax, printers, etc."
"LAN (Local Area Network): It is used for a small geographical location like office, hospital, school, etc."
"HAN (House Area Network): It is actually a LAN that is used within a house and used to connect homely devices like personal computers, phones, printers, etc."
CAN (Campus Area Network): It is a connection of devices within a campus area which links to other departments of the organization within the same campus.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): It is used to connect the devices which span to large cities like metropolitan cities over a wide geographical area.
WAN (Wide Area Network): It is used over a wide geographical location that may range to connect cities and countries.
GAN (Global Area Network): It uses satellites to connect devices over global are.
POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol version3. POP is responsible for accessing the mail service on a client machine. POP3 works on two models such as Delete mode and Keep mode.
MAC stands for Media Access Control. It is the address of the device at the Media Access Control Layer of Network Architecture. It is a unique address means no two devices can have same MAC addresses.
IP address is a unique 32 bit software address of a computer in a network system.
"There are three ranges of IP addresses that have been reserved for IP addresses. They are not valid for use on the internet. If you want to access internet on these private IPs, you must have to use proxy server or NAT server."
A public IP address is an address taken by the Internet Service Provider which facilitates you to communication on the internet.
APIPA is an acronym stands for Automatic Private IP Addressing. This feature is generally found in Microsoft operating system.
ADS is a microsoft technology used to manage the computers and other devices.
"ADS allows the network administrators to manage the domains, users and objects within the network."
"ADS consists of three main tiers:

Domain: Users that use the same database will be grouped into a single domain.
Tree: Multiple domains can be grouped into a single tree.
Forest: Multiple trees can be grouped into a single forest."
Domain: Users that use the same database will be grouped into a single domain.
Tree: Multiple domains can be grouped into a single tree.
Forest: Multiple trees can be grouped into a single forest.
RAID is a method to provide Fault Tolerance by using multiple Hard Disc Drives.
"Anonymous FTP is used to grant users access to files in public servers. Users which are allowed access to data in these servers do not need to identify themselves, but instead log in as an anonymous guest."
A protocol is a set of rules which is used to govern all the aspects of information communication.
Syntax: It specifies the structure or format of the data. It also specifies the order in which they are presented.
Semantics: It specifies the meaning of each section of bits.
Timing: Timing specifies two characteristics: When data should be sent and how fast it can be sent.
There are two types of client/server programs. First is directly used by the users and the second supports application programs.
The Domain Name System is the second type supporting program that is used by other programs such as to find the IP address of an e-mail recipient.
A link is connectivity between two devices which includes the cables and protocols used in order to make communication between devices.
OSI reference model: OSI reference model is an ISO standard which defines a networking framework for implementing the protocols in seven layers. These seven layers can be grouped into three categories:
"Network layer: Layer 1, Layer 2 and layer 3 are the network layers."
"Application layer. Layer 5, Layer 6 and Layer 7 are the application layers."
It is the lowest layer of the OSI reference model.
It is used for the transmission of an unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.
Physical layer transmits the data either in the form of electrical/optical or mechanical form.
"The physical layer is mainly used for the physical connection between the devices, and such physical connection can be made by using twisted-pair cable, fibre-optic or wireless transmission media."
It is used for transferring the data from one node to another node.
It receives the data from the network layer and converts the data into data frames and then attach the physical address to these frames which are sent to the physical layer.
"It enables the error-free transfer of data from one node to another node.
Functions of Data-link layer:"
"Frame synchronization: Data-link layer converts the data into frames, and it ensures that the destination must recognize the starting and ending of each frame."
Flow control: Data-link layer controls the data flow within the network.
Error control: It detects and corrects the error occurred during the transmission from source to destination.
Addressing: Data-link layer attach the physical address with the data frames so that the individual machines can be easily identified.
"Link management: Data-link layer manages the initiation, maintenance and, termination of the link between the source and destination for the effective exchange of data."
Network layer converts the logical address into the physical address.
"It provides the routing concept means it determines the best route for the packet to travel from source to the destination.
Functions of network layer:"
Routing: The network layer determines the best route from source to destination. This function is known as routing.
Logical addressing: The network layer defines the addressing scheme to identify each device uniquely.
Packetizing: The network layer receives the data from the upper layer and converts the data into packets. This process is known as packetizing.
Internetworking: The network layer provides the logical connection between the different types of networks for forming a bigger network.
Fragmentation: It is a process of dividing the packets into the fragments.
It delivers the message through the network and provides error checking so that no error occurs during the transfer of data.
"It provides two kinds of services:

Connection-oriented transmission: In this transmission, the receiver sends the acknowledgement to the sender after the packet has been received.
Connectionless transmission: In this transmission, the receiver does not send the acknowledgement to the sender."
"Connection-oriented transmission: In this transmission, the receiver sends the acknowledgement to the sender after the packet has been received."
"Connectionless transmission: In this transmission, the receiver does not send the acknowledgement to the sender."
"The main responsibility of the session layer is beginning, maintaining and ending the communication between the devices."
Session layer also reports the error coming from the upper layers.
Session layer establishes and maintains the session between the two users.
The presentation layer is also known as a Translation layer as it translates the data from one format to another format.
"At the sender side, this layer translates the data format used by the application layer to the common format and at the receiver side, this layer translates the common format into a format used by the application layer.
Functions of presentation layer:

Character code translation
Data conversion
Data compression
Data encryption"
It is the topmost layer of the OSI reference model.
"Application layer protocols are file transfer protocol, simple mail transfer protocol, domain name system, etc."
The most widely used application protocol is HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol ). A user sends the request for the web page using HTTP.
"The OSI physical layer is used to convert data bits into electrical signals and vice versa. On this layer, network devices and cable types are considered and setup."
"OSI session layer provides the protocols and means for two devices on the network to communicate with each other by holding a session. This layer is responsible for setting up the session, managing information exchange during the session, and tear-down process upon termination of the session."
The maximum length of UTP cable is 90 to 100 meters.
RIP stands for Routing Information Protocol. It is accessed by the routers to send data from one network to another.
RIP is a dynamic protocol which is used to find the best route from source to the destination over a network by using the hop count algorithm.
Routers use this protocol to exchange the network topology information.
This protocol can be used by small or medium-sized networks.
TCP/IP is short for Transmission Control Protocol /Internet protocol. It is a set of protocol layers that is designed for exchanging data on different types of networks.
"The ""netstat"" is a command line utility program. It gives useful information about the current TCP/IP setting of a connection."
"The ""ping"" is a utility program that allows you to check the connectivity between the network devices. You can ping devices using its IP address or name."
Sneakernet is the earliest form of networking where the data is physically transported using removable media.
The processes on each machine that communicate at a given layer are called peer-peer process.
"A switch receives packets faster than the shared link. It can accommodate and stores in its memory, for an extended period of time, then the switch will eventually run out of buffer space, and some packets will have to be dropped. This state is called a congested state."
"In Networking, multiplexing is the set of techniques that is used to allow the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link."
Address sharing provides security benefit instead of routing. That's because host PCs on the Internet can only see the public IP address of the external interface on the computer that provides address translation and not the private IP addresses on the internal network.
RSA is short for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm. It is mostly used for public key encryption.
Following are the differences between the TCP/IP model and OSI model:
