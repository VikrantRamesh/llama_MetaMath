Propagation Delay = (Distance between routers) / (Velocity of propagation)
Rule 1) Send one data packet at a time. Rule 2) Send the next packet only after receiving acknowledgement for the previous.
Rule 1) Send acknowledgement after receiving and consuming a data packet. Rule 2) After consuming packet acknowledgement need to be sent (Flow Control)
"3. Delayed Acknowledgement/Data: After a timeout on the sender side, a long-delayed acknowledgement might be wrongly considered as acknowledgement of some other recent packet."
The above 3 problems are resolved by Stop and Wait for ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) that does both error control and flow control.
3. Delayed Acknowledgement: This is resolved by introducing sequence numbers for acknowledgement also.
"1) Sender A sends a data frame or packet with sequence number 0. 2) Receiver B, after receiving the data frame, sends an acknowledgement with sequence number 1 (the sequence number of the next expected data frame or packet) There is only a one-bit sequence number that implies that both sender and receiver have a buffer for one frame or packet only."
"Stop and Wait ARQ has very less efficiency , it can be improved by increasing the window size. Also , for better efficiency , Go back N and Selective Repeat Protocols are used."
"The Stop and Wait ARQ solves the main three problems but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgement even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection). To solve this problem, we can send more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number. We will be discussing these protocols in the next articles. So Stop and Wait ARQ may work fine where propagation delay is very less for example LAN connections but performs badly for distant connections like satellite connections."
"Packet Switching in computer networks is a method of transferring data to a network in the form of packets. In order to transfer the file fast and efficiently manner over the network and minimize the transmission latency, the data is broken into small pieces of variable length, called Packet. At the destination, all these small parts (packets) have to be reassembled, belonging to the same file. A packet is composed of a payload and various control information. No pre-setup or reservation of resources is needed. Packet Switching uses the Store and Forward technique while switching the packets; while forwarding the packet each hop first stores that packet then forwards. This technique is very beneficial because packets may get discarded at any hop for some reason. More than one path is possible between a pair of sources and destinations. Each packet contains the Source and destination address using which they independently travel through the network. In other words, packets belonging to the same file may or may not travel through the same path. If there is congestion at some path, packets are allowed to choose different paths possible over an existing network."
"In packet switching the data is divided into small packets which allow faster movement of data. Each packet contains two parts that is Header and Payload, the header on each packet conation information. Below is the diagram of how packet switching works."
"Before starting the transmission, it establishes a logical path or virtual connection using a signaling protocol, between sender and receiver and all packets belongs to this flow will follow this predefined route. Virtual Circuit ID is provided by switches/routers to uniquely identify this virtual connection. Data is divided into small units and all these small units are appended with help of sequence numbers. Packets arrive in order at the destination. Overall, three phases take place here- The setup, data transfer and tear-down phases."
"All address information is only transferred during the setup phase. Once the route to a destination is discovered, entry is added to the switching table of each intermediate node. During data transfer, packet header (local header) may contain information such as length, timestamp, sequence number, etc."
"Connection-oriented switching is very useful in switched WAN. Some popular protocols which use the Virtual Circuit Switching approach are X.25, Frame-Relay, ATM, and MPLS(Multi-Protocol Label Switching)."
"Unlike Connection-oriented packet switching, In Connectionless Packet Switching each packet contains all necessary addressing information such as source address, destination address, port numbers, etc. Packets belonging to one flow may take different routes because routing decisions are made dynamically, so the packets that arrived at the destination might be out of order. It has no connection setup and teardown phase, like Virtual Circuits. Packet delivery is not guaranteed in connectionless packet switching, so reliable delivery must be provided by end systems using additional protocols."
To send a packet from A to B there are delays since this is a Store and Forward network.
"In Computer Network ,there are various ways through which different components are connected to one another. Network Topology is the way that defines the structure, and how these components are connected to each other."
The arrangement of a network that comprises nodes and connecting lines via sender and receiver is referred to as Network Topology. The various network topologies are:
"Point-to-Point Topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth."
"In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. In Mesh Topology, the protocols used are AHCP (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocols), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), etc."
Figure 1: Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels. These channels are known as links.
"A common example of mesh topology is the internet backbone, where various internet service providers are connected to each other via dedicated channels. This topology is also used in military communication systems and aircraft navigation systems."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology."
"In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node. The hub can be passive in nature i.e., not an intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices, at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as an active hub. Active hubs have repeaters in them. Coaxial cables or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers. In Star Topology, many popular Ethernet LAN protocols are used as CD(Collision Detection), CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), etc."
Figure 2: A star topology having four systems connected to a single point of connection i.e. hub.
A common example of star topology is a local area network (LAN) in an office where all computers are connected to a central hub. This topology is also used in wireless networks where all devices are connected to a wireless access point.
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology."
"Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes. In Bus Topology, various MAC (Media Access Control) protocols are followed by LAN ethernet connections like TDMA, Pure Aloha, CDMA, Slotted Aloha, etc."
Figure 3: A bus topology with shared backbone cable. The nodes are connected to the channel via drop lines.
"A common example of bus topology is the Ethernet LAN, where all devices are connected to a single coaxial cable or twisted pair cable. This topology is also used in cable television networks. For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology."
"In a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network."
"The data flows in one direction, i.e. it is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology. In-Ring Topology, the Token Ring Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data."
Figure 4: A ring topology comprises 4 stations connected with each forming a ring. The most common access method of ring topology is token passing.
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology."
"This topology is the variation of the Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data. In Tree Topology, protocols like DHCP and SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration ) are used."
"Figure 5: In this, the various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater. This data flow from top to bottom i.e. from the central hub to the secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e. devices to the secondary hub and then to the central hub. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes."
"A common example of a tree topology is the hierarchy in a large organization. At the top of the tree is the CEO, who is connected to the different departments or divisions (child nodes) of the company. Each department has its own hierarchy, with managers overseeing different teams (grandchild nodes). The team members (leaf nodes) are at the bottom of the hierarchy, connected to their respective managers and departments."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology."
This topological technology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above. Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form. It means these can be individuals such as Ring or Star topology or can be a combination of various types of topologies seen above. Each individual topology uses the protocol that has been discussed earlier.
Figure 6: The above figure shows the structure of the Hybrid topology. As seen it contains a combination of all different types of networks.
"A common example of a hybrid topology is a university campus network. The network may have a backbone of a star topology, with each building connected to the backbone through a switch or router. Within each building, there may be a bus or ring topology connecting the different rooms and offices. The wireless access points also create a mesh topology for wireless devices. This hybrid topology allows for efficient communication between different buildings while providing flexibility and redundancy within each building."
"For more, refer to the Advantages and Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology."
"An access network is a type of network which physically connects an end system to the immediate router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system. Examples of access networks are ISP, home networks, enterprise networks, ADSL, mobile network, FTTH etc."
"A crucial element of contemporary telecommunications technology are mainly access networks. They make quick data transfer and dependable, affordable communication possible. Businesses can also benefit from access networks’ secure voice and video conferencing services over short- and long-distances, high-speed data transfers, and other features. Access networks’ capacity to handle a lot of traffic at once lowers the expenses associated with long-distance communications. Additionally, they make it simpler for companies to use satellite or fibre optic links to reach a global audience and access a variety of online services."
"At first, Before they may connect to an ISP, they must have a modem, router, or switch. Through a variety of network protocols, this device connects to the ISP’s server and activates the connection. Users can select from a range of connection technologies, such as DSL, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or 5G, depending on their location and type of equipment also."
"The data is delivered across numerous linked devices in an access network using internal routing protocols like Internet Protocol (IP). This eliminates the need for external switches or routers by enabling direct communication between all devices connected to the same network. Additionally, access networks include features like quality of service (QoS), which prioritise traffic according to importance and so help networks run better."
"Computer networks that provide connection-oriented services are called Virtual Circuits while those providing connection-less services are called Datagram networks. For prior knowledge, the Internet that we use is based on a Datagram network (connection-less) at the network level as all packets from a source to a destination do not follow the same path."
"1. Permanent Virtual Circuits(PVC): The communication management station, which is the telco’s central office, manually configures the switches, which offer performance comparable to dedicated lines. The main use for these always-on circuits is high-speed communication. PVCs require telco resources (switches) to be allocated to a single communication circuit whether or not that circuit is in use, making them an expensive solution for wide-area networks (WANs)."
"2. Switched Virtual circuits (SVCs): As soon as a communication session is established, the switches are set up. SVCs are released at the conclusion of the session and can be used to create new channels of communication. This is the process of normal phone communication. SVCs, which are billed on a per-minute basis, are generally utilised in WANs when backups to dedicated leased lines are required."
"As early as 1924, an AT&T engineer, Henry Nyquist, realized that even a perfect channel has a finite transmission capacity. He derived an equation expressing the maximum data rate for a finite-bandwidth noiseless channel. In 1948, Claude Shannon carried Nyquist’s work further and extended to it the case of a channel subject to random(that is, thermodynamic) noise (Shannon, 1948). This paper is the most important paper in all of the information theory."
"Data rate governs the speed of data transmission. A very important consideration in data communication is how fast we can send data, in bits per second, over a channel. Data rate depends upon 3 factors:"
"Two theoretical formulas were developed to calculate the data rate: one by Nyquist for a noiseless channel, another by Shannon for a noisy channel."
"1. Noiseless Channel: Nyquist Bit Rate: For a noiseless channel, the Nyquist bit rate formula defines the theoretical maximum bit rate Nyquist proved that if an arbitrary signal has been run through a low-pass filter of bandwidth, the filtered signal can be completely reconstructed by making only 2*Bandwidth (exact) samples per second. Sampling the line faster than 2*Bandwidth times per second is pointless because the higher-frequency components that such sampling could recover have already been filtered out. If the signal consists of L discrete levels, Nyquist’s theorem states:"
"In the above equation, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, L is the number of signal levels used to represent data, and BitRate is the bit rate in bits per second. Bandwidth is a fixed quantity, so it cannot be changed. Hence, the data rate is directly proportional to the number of signal levels."
"2. Noisy Channel Shannon Capacity: In reality, we cannot have a noiseless channel; the channel is always noisy. Shannon capacity is used, to determine the theoretical highest data rate for a noisy channel:"
"In the above equation, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, and capacity is the capacity of the channel in bits per second.  Bandwidth is a fixed quantity, so it cannot be changed. Hence, the channel capacity is directly proportional to the power of the signal, as SNR = (Power of signal) / (power of noise)."
The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is usually expressed in decibels (dB) given by the formula:
So for example a signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 is commonly expressed as:
"The maximum data rate, also known as the channel capacity, is the theoretical limit of the amount of information that can be transmitted over a communication channel. The maximum data rate for noiseless and noisy channels can be calculated using Shannon’s theorem."
"Advances in digital signal processing and error correction techniques have allowed for the development of more sophisticated modulation and encoding schemes that can increase the maximum data rate of noisy channels. However, these techniques can also increase the complexity and cost of the communication system."
"Noiseless channels have a higher maximum data rate and provide error-free transmission. However, they are not realistic as most channels have some degree of noise. Noisy channels have a lower maximum data rate but are more realistic, and techniques like error correction can be used to improve transmission reliability. The choice of channel type depends on the specific needs of the communication system."
We take a close look at so-called WiFi which is also known as IEEE standard 802.11
"Consider the situation depicted in the figure, where each of the four nodes is able to send and receive signals that reach just the nodes to its immediate left and right. For example, B can exchange frames with A and C but it cannot reach D, while C can reach B and D but not A. (A and D’s reach is not shown in the figure.) Suppose both A and C want to communicate with B and so they each send it a frame. A and C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far. These two frames collide with each other at B, but unlike an Ethernet, neither A nor C is aware of this collision. A and C are said to be hidden nodes with respect to each other. According to Wikipedia, the hidden node problem can be defined as “In wireless networking, the hidden node problem or hidden terminal problem occurs when a node is visible to a wireless access point (AP), but not to other nodes communicating with that AP.”"
"This is because the nodes A and C are out of range of each other(and so cannot detect a collision while transmitting). Thus, Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) does not work, and collisions occur. The data received by the access point is corrupted due to the collision. To overcome the hidden node problem, RTS/CTS handshaking (IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS) is implemented in addition to the Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. A related problem, called the exposed node problem, occurs under the following stated circumstances: Suppose B is sending to A (as in the above Figure). Node C is aware of this communication because it hears B’s transmission. It would be a mistake for C to conclude that it cannot transmit to anyone just because it can hear B’s transmission. For example, suppose C wants to transmit to node D. This is not a problem since C’s transmission to D will not interfere with A’s ability to receive from B. We address these problems by an algorithm known as Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA). The sender and receiver exchange frames with each other before transmitting data. This informs all nearby nodes that a transmission is about to begin. Sender transmits Request to Send (RTS) frame to receiver. The receiver then replies with clear to send (CTS) frame back to the sender. Any node that receives CTS frame knows that it is close to the receiver, therefore, cannot transmit a frame. Any node that receives the RTS frame but not the CTS frame knows that is not close to the receiver to interfere with it, So it is free to transmit data. Reference – Wikipedia"
"Fairness: Collision avoidance protocols like CSMA/CA ensure that all devices have an equal opportunity to transmit data, regardless of their position in the network. This helps to ensure fairness in the network."
"Attackers’ task is comparatively very easy when they can enter the network they want to attack. Ethernet LANs are very much vulnerable to attack as the switch ports are open to use by default. Various attacks such as Dos attack at layer 2, address spoofing can take place. If the administrator has control over the network then obviously the network is safe. To take total control over the switch ports, the user can use a feature called port-security. If somehow prevent an unauthorized user to use these ports, then the security will increase up to a great extent at layer 2. Users can secure a port in two steps:"
"Port security – Switches learn MAC addresses when the frame is forwarded through a switch port. By using port security, users can limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned to a port, set static MAC addresses, and set penalties for that port if it is used by an unauthorized user. Users can either use restrict, shut down or protect port-security commands. Let’s discuss these violation modes:"
"Note – The port security will work on access port only i.e to enable port security, the user first has to make it an access port. Configuration – Applying port-security on fa0/1 interface of switch .first, convert the port to an access port and will enable port-security."
Use sticky command so that it will learn the Mac address dynamically and will provide the limit and the appropriate action that should be taken.
"If the user wants to provide a static entry, then configure that by starting its Mac address."
Switch ports are Layer 2 interfaces that are used to carry layer 2 traffic. A single switch port can carry single VLAN traffic. Frames are handled differently according to the type of link they are traversing. Note: All switch ports are assigned VLAN 1 by default (VLAN 1 cannot be modified or deleted). There are 2 different types of ports in a switched environment:
"These switch ports belong to carry the traffic of only one VLAN. By default, it will carry the traffic of native VLAN (VLAN 1) . If the switch ports are assigned as access ports then they can be considered as the switch ports belongs to a single broadcast domain. Any traffic arriving on these switch ports is considered as it belongs to the VLAN assigned to the port. Example:"
"Here is a simple topology in which 2 switches are connected and only the default VLAN (VLAN 1)is configured on both switches i.e all the switch ports of both switches belong to a single broadcast domain. Now, note that the link between the switches has to be configured as an access port because only a single VLAN (VLAN 1) data has to be exchanged. Now after assigning an IP address to PC1-192.168.1.1/24, PC2-192.168.1.2/24, PC3-192.168.1.3/24, PC3-192.168.1.4/24, the user shall configure the link between the 2 switches as an access port."
"Here, there is no need to assign VLAN to the ports as all the switch ports on both switches are configured as VLAN 1 by default."
"These switch ports belong to and carry the traffic of more than one VLAN. This is a great advantage as to carry the traffic of a group of VLAN, a single switch port can be used. These are of great use if the user wants to exchange traffic between more than one switch having more than one VLAN configured. To identify traffic belongs to VLAN, the VLAN identification method (802.1q or ISL) is used. Also, to carry traffic between more than one VLAN, then inter VLAN routing is required, in which the link between router and switch is configured as trunk as the link has to carry the traffic of more than one VLAN (in case of a router on a stick configuration not in inter VLAN routing by layer 3 switches). Note: Trunk links can carry the traffic of different VLANs across them but by default, if the links between switches are not trunk then only information from the configured access VLAN will be exchanged. Example:"
"Here is a simple topology in which 2 switches are connected and VLANs 2 and 3 are configured on both switches as shown. Note – A user has not assigned any VLANs to other ports of switches, therefore, the other ports will be in VLAN 1 by default."
"Now, note that the link between the switches has to be configured as a trunk port because here more than one VLAN (VLAN 1, 2, 3) frame has to be exchanged between the switches. Now assigning IP address to PC1-12.168.1.1/24, PC2-192.168.2.1/24, PC3-192.168.1.2/24, PC3-192.168.2.2/24. Now, the first user has to make VLANs on both switches."
"Now, a user has more than one VLAN configured on both switches. Therefore, users have to assign the VLANs to their respective ports on Switch1."
"Now, configure the link between 2 switches as a trunk port."
"As a result of this, now the user can carry more than one VLAN traffic from one switch to another switch (here, only configuration of switch ports are shown not the configuration of the router is shown. To perform inter VLAN routing, a configuration of the router is also needed)."
EtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology in which multiple physical port links are grouped into one logical link. It is used to provide high-speed links and redundancy. A maximum of 8 links can be aggregated to form a single logical link.
"EtherChannel, also known as Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), is a technique used in computer networks to combine multiple physical links between two network switches into a single logical link. This logical link provides increased bandwidth and redundancy, as well as improved load balancing."
"EtherChannel works by grouping two or more physical links between switches into a single logical link. This logical link is treated as a single entity, with the switches treating it as a single link. Traffic is distributed across the physical links in the logical link, providing increased bandwidth and improved load balancing."
"Here is a topology in which two switches are connected with one PC each. The link between the switches and PC is 1000mb/s and the link between the switches is 100mb/s. Now, suppose if you want to send traffic of more than 100mb/s then we have congestion as the link between the switches is of 100mb/s only and packets will start dropping. Now, to solve this problem, we should have a high-speed link between the switches. To achieve this, We can simply replace the current link with a high-speed link or we can bundle up more than one link of the same speed of 100mb/s. By forming an EtherChannel, you can bundle up more than one link into a single logical link. But, as you connect the switches with more than one link, STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) will block the least redundant link. As we have made an EtherChannel, all the links (that are grouped as one logical link k) will be treated as single logical links therefore no link will be blocked and also, it will provide us high-speed link and redundancy in our network. Criteria – To form an EtherChannel, all ports should have:"
"EtherChannel protocols – To form an EtherChannel, there are 2 protocols, port aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and link aggregation control protocol (LACP). 1. Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) – The Cisco proprietary protocol Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is an EtherChannel technology. It’s a type of data/traffic load balancing that involves the logical aggregation of Cisco Ethernet switch ports. A PAgP EtherChannel can merge up to eight physical links into one virtual link. LACP, or Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE open standard. These are namely:"
There is a small topology in which 2 switches S1 and S2 are connected with each other and we have to bundle these two links into a single logical link.
"Here, the user has used the mode desirable and switch-port mode trunk. The modes should be the same on both switches therefore the user will configure this on the other switch also."
"2. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) – Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE protocol, originally defined in 802.3ad, used to form an EtherChannel. This protocol is almost similar to Cisco PAgP. There are different modes in which you can configure your interface. These are namely:"
"Taking the same topology, you will now configure LACP on both switches. First, configuring for S1:"
"Increased bandwidth: By combining multiple physical links into a single logical link, EtherChannel provides increased bandwidth between switches. This can help improve network performance and reduce bottlenecks."
"Improved redundancy: EtherChannel provides improved redundancy by allowing traffic to be routed over multiple physical links. If one link fails, traffic is automatically routed over the remaining links."
"Load balancing: EtherChannel distributes traffic across multiple physical links, providing improved load balancing and preventing congestion on any one link."
Simplified network configuration: EtherChannel simplifies network configuration by treating multiple physical links as a single logical link. This can reduce the complexity of network configurations and make troubleshooting easier.
"Cost-effective: EtherChannel can be a cost-effective way to increase bandwidth and redundancy in a network, as it allows existing physical links to be used rather than requiring new hardware."
"Prerequisite : Sliding Window Protocol – Set 1 (Sender Side), Set 2 (Receiver Side) Why Selective Repeat Protocol? The go-back-n protocol works well if errors are less, but if the line is poor it wastes a lot of bandwidth on retransmitted frames. An alternative strategy, the selective repeat protocol, is to allow the receiver to accept and buffer the frames following a damaged or lost one. Selective Repeat attempts to retransmit only those packets that are actually lost (due to errors) :"
"Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) : This protocol(SRP) is mostly identical to GBN protocol, except that buffers are used and the receiver, and the sender, each maintains a window of size. SRP works better when the link is very unreliable. Because in this case, retransmission tends to happen more frequently, selectively retransmitting frames is more efficient than retransmitting all of them. SRP also requires full-duplex link. backward acknowledgements are also in progress."
"Figure – the sender only retransmits frames, for which a NAK is receivedEfficiency of Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) is same as GO-Back-N’s efficiency :"
"if  Tt(ack) :Transmission delay for acknowledgment , Tq: Queuing delay and  Tpro: Processing delay is mention"
=Tt(data) /Tt(data) + 2*Tp + Tq + Tpro + Tt(ack)
"Above formula is applicable for any condition, if any of the things are not given we assume it to be 0."
"Prerequisite – Difference between Unipolar, Polar and Bipolar Line Coding Schemes"
Manchester encoding is a synchronous clock encoding technique used by the physical layer of the Open System Interconnection [OSI] to encode the clock and data of a synchronous bit stream.  The idea of RZ and the idea of-L are combined in manchester
"Different encoding techniques are used in data communication to ensure data security and transmission speed. Manchester encoding is an example of digital encoding. Because each data bit length is defined by default, it differs from other digital encoding schemes. The bit state is defined by the direction of the transition. Bit status is represented in various ways by different systems, although most systems use 1 bit for low to high transitions and 0 bit for high to low transitions."
"In manchester duration of a bit is divided into two halves. The voltage remains the same at one level during the first half & moves to the other level.The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.Differential Manchester,on the other hand,combines the idea of RZ and NRZ-I. There is always a transition at the middle of the bit, but the bit values are determined at the beginning of the bit. if next bit is zero there is transition if next bit is 1 there is none."
"The binary data to be transmitted over the cable are not sent as NRZ [Non-return-to-zero]. Non-return-to-zero [NRZ] – NRZ code’s voltage level is constant during a bit interval. When there is a long sequence of 0s and 1s, there is a problem at the receiving end. The problem is that the synchronization is lost due to a lack of transmissions. It is of 2 types:"
Only drawback is the signal rate.The signal rate is manchester and differential is double that for NRZ. The reason is that there is always one transition at the middle of the bit and maybe one transition at the end of each bit.
"Self-clocking: Manchester encoding is self-clocking, which means that the receiver can synchronize its clock with the transmitter’s clock. This ensures that the data is transmitted and received at the same rate, and there is no need for a separate clock signal."
"Reduced DC component: Manchester encoding eliminates the DC component in the transmitted signal, which reduces the risk of errors due to interference from external sources."
"Error detection: Manchester encoding provides a mechanism for detecting errors in the transmitted data. Any change in the voltage level within a time interval indicates a bit error, which can be detected and corrected."
Simplicity: Manchester encoding is a relatively simple encoding scheme that can be implemented using simple digital circuits.
"Lower data rate: Manchester encoding has a lower data rate than other encoding schemes, such as non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding, which means that it takes more time to transmit the same amount of data."
"Higher bandwidth requirement: Manchester encoding requires a higher bandwidth than other encoding schemes, as each bit requires two voltage transitions within each time interval."
"Clock synchronization: Although Manchester encoding is self-clocking, it still requires the receiver to synchronize its clock with the transmitter’s clock, which can be a challenge in some situations."
"Reduced transmission distance: Manchester encoding has a reduced transmission distance compared to other encoding schemes, as the signal loses strength over long distances due to the need for frequent voltage transitions."
"Telecom Networks are systems of interconnected communication devices and equipment that enable people to communicate with each other over long distances. These networks use various technologies and protocols to facilitate the transmission of voice, data, and video signals between devices, including smartphones, computers, and other communication devices. Telecom networks play a critical role in modern society, providing essential communication services to individuals, businesses, and organizations. They enable people to communicate with each other across vast distances, enabling global communication and facilitating international trade and commerce."
"Telecom Networks are made up of various components, including transmission systems, switching systems, and network management systems. These components work together to ensure that communication signals are transmitted and delivered efficiently and securely."
"In recent years, telecom networks have evolved significantly, driven by advances in technology and changing communication needs. Modern networks use advanced technologies like 5G, fiber-optic cables, and cloud computing to provide faster, more reliable communication services to users. Telecom networks are essential components of modern communication infrastructure, enabling people to communicate and connect with each other in new and innovative ways."
"Telecom Networks are mostly used today for wide-area communication. Stringing a wire between every pair of telephones that might want to communicate was not a good long-term strategy. A better idea was to connect all the telephones to a central switching office. There an operator could connect one telephone to another via a switchboard. Routing a Telephone Call: A call is routed up through higher-level switching offices until it reaches a switching office that can reach the destination telephone by connecting with lower-level switching offices, which examine the digits of the telephone number you dialed to make these decisions. Connection-Oriented Services – I: A dedicated connection between the endpoints is maintained throughout the session. Usually, this means that the quality of service can be reasonably guaranteed to the extent of the bandwidth for the channel that is established. Message bits arrive in the same order in which they are sent. A traditional telephone circuit is a circuit-switched connection-oriented system. Transmission Media in Telephone Systems: In traditional analog telephone systems, the telephone is connected to the local exchange via category 3 UTP cables. This connection is called the local loop. It is typically between 1km and 10km in length. Higher up in the hierarchy, higher bandwidth cables are used to carry multiple telephone calls. This is far cheaper than using separate cables for separate calls. Specifically, digital lines on fiber are used. Analog systems used a technique called frequency division multiplexing (FDM) to do this. The Local Loop: The subscriber handsets are powered by a battery bank in the exchange. With echo suppressors, the transmission is half-duplex. With echo cancellers, it is possible to have full-duplex communication. Since the local loop is still analog, we need modems for sending digital data. Since one bit is used for control purposes, we usually get 56kbps speed. Depending on the line condition, modems may automatically negotiate a lower speed. Signaling: Signaling refers to the information exchanges between terminal devices, exchanges, and routers for setting up circuits, termination, billing, advanced network services, etc. In common Channel signaling which is in the band, some of the bits in the frame are used for this purpose, in which SS7 is considered standard. Whether In-band or Out of band, logically the switch controllers may be considered to be an overlay network in the control plane. Out-of-band signaling (CCIS – Common Channel Interoffice Signaling) is more flexible as it allows arbitrarily complex message transfer, as they do not interfere with the regular channel."
Telecom networks are systems of interconnected communication devices and equipment that allow people to communicate with each other over long distances.
"Digital Technology in Telephone Networks: Over the past 30 years, much of the traditional analog telephone network has been replaced by digital technology. A device called a codec (coder/decoder) is used to convert analog voice signals into digital information that can be handled by digital technology. The codec is also used to convert the digital signals back into analog voice signals that can be handled by the older analog technology."
Only the local loop is still analog and this loop can be replaced by Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connections. It was envisaged as an end-to-end digital service. Home users would be connected by the same Cat3 cable. the digital bit streams are time-multiplexed. The system uses Out band signaling and uses the D channel for that. NT1 is a network terminating device which connects to the ISDN exchange on one side and a local passive bus on the other from which up to eight terminal devices can hang. ISDN turned out to be very expensive and obsolete even before the standard was finalized. The vision of broadband ISDN was sought to be realized by ATM. Digital Subscriber Loop: The next attempt for converting the analog local loop went in two directions:
"It is impossible to overestimate the influence of telecom networks on society. They have completely changed how people interact with one another and conduct business on a global scale. It’s difficult to remember a period before wireless technology, which enables us to connect from anywhere at any time, existed."
"To despite certain drawbacks like addiction and privacy invasion, these are greatly overshadowed by the advantages they provide. As technology advances, telecom networks will continue to expand and change; the future should excite us as well."
Switched communication networks are those in which data transferred from source to destination is routed between various intermediate nodes. Switching is the technique by which nodes control or switch data to transmit it between specific points on a network. There are 3 common switching techniques:
"Message Switching – Message switching was a technique developed as an alternative to circuit switching before packet switching was introduced. In message switching, end-users communicate by sending and receiving messages that included the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest individual unit. Also, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. There are a number of intermediate nodes that transfer data and ensure that the message reaches its destination. Message switched data networks are hence called hop-by-hop systems. They provide 2 distinct and important characteristics:"
"Message switching network consists of transmission links (channels), store-and-forward switch nodes, and end stations as shown in the following picture:"
"Characteristics of message switching – Message switching is advantageous as it enables efficient usage of network resources. Also, because of the store-and-forward capability of intermediary nodes, traffic can be efficiently regulated and controlled. Message delivery as one unit, rather than in pieces, is another benefit. However, message switching has certain disadvantages as well. Since messages are stored indefinitely at each intermediate node, switches require a large storage capacity. Also, these are pretty slow. This is because at each node, first there is a wait till the entire message is received, then it must be stored and transmitted after processing the next node and links to it depending on availability and channel traffic. Hence, message switching cannot be used for real-time or interactive applications like a video conference."
Advantages of Message Switching – Message switching has the following advantages:
Disadvantages of Message Switching – Message switching has the following disadvantages:
"Applications – The store-and-forward method was implemented in telegraph message switching centres. Today, although many major networks and systems are packet-switched or circuit-switched networks, their delivery processes can be based on message switching. For example, in most electronic mail systems the delivery process is based on message switching, while the network is in fact either circuit-switched or packet-switched."
Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet or token ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.
"In order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of standby power, much less than normal operating power. Disabling wake-on-LAN when not needed can therefore vary slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket."
"Magic Packet Structure The magic packet is a broadcast frame containing anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer’s 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes. Since the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it may be sent as any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a UDP datagram to port 0, 7, or 9, or directly over Ethernet as EtherType 0x0842."
The Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be very simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface card with minimal power requirement. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer the MAC address is required and makes IP addresses and DNS names meaningless.
Transmission mode means transferring data between two devices. It is also known as a communication mode. Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected.
"1. Simplex Mode –In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction. Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output."
"2. Half-Duplex Mode –In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction. Example: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions."
"3. Full-Duplex Mode –In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways:"
"Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions. Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time."
"Prerequisite – Basics of Wi-fi MAC layer provides functionality for several tasks like control medium access, can also offer support for roaming, authentication, and power conservation. The basic services provided by MAC are the mandatory asynchronous data service and optional time-bounded service. IEEE 802.11 defines two MAC sub-layers:-"
MAC Frame: The MAC layer frame consists of 9 fields. The following figure shows the basic structure of an IEEE 802.11 MAC data frame along with the content of the frame control field.
"Frame Control Field: The frame control field contains information about the type of frame, the data rate, and the power management status."
Duration Field: The duration field specifies the length of time that the channel will be occupied by the transmission.
Address Fields: The address fields specify the source and destination MAC addresses of the Wi-Fi devices involved in the communication.
Sequence Control Field: The sequence control field is used to identify and manage the transmission sequence of the frames.
"Frame Body: The frame body contains the actual data being transmitted between Wi-Fi devices, such as IP packets, TCP segments, or UDP datagrams."
Frame Check Sequence: The frame check sequence (FCS) is used to check the integrity of the data transmitted in the frame and to detect any transmission errors.
"Management, Control, and Data Frames: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame defines three types of frames: management frames, control frames, and data frames. Management frames are used for network management, control frames are used for coordination between Wi-Fi devices, and data frames are used for the transmission of actual data."
"Fragmentation: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame supports fragmentation, which allows large data packets to be divided into smaller fragments for transmission."
Acknowledgments: The IEEE 802.11 MAC frame uses acknowledgments to confirm the successful transmission of frames and to request the retransmission of any frames that were not successfully received.
"Only the administrator should have complete access to the network while the other employees like junior network engineer need not full access to the network device. A junior-level engineer generally requires only to crosscheck the configuration of the device, not to add or delete any configuration so why should give full access to that employee? For these types of scenarios, the administrator defines access to the devices according to the roles of the user. Role-based Access Control – The concept of Role-based Access Control is to create a set of permissions and assign these permissions to a user or group. With the help of these permissions, only limited access to users can be provided therefore level of security is increased. There are different ways to perform RBAC such as creating custom privilege levels or creating views. Custom level privilege – When we take a console of the router, we enter into the user-level mode. The user-level mode has privilege level 1. By typing enable, we enter into a privileged mode where the privilege level is 15. A user with privilege level 15 can access all the commands that are at level 15 or below. By creating a custom privilege level (between 2 and 14) and assigning commands to it, the administrator can provide subset of commands to the user. Configuration – First we will add a command to our privilege level say 8 and assign a password to it."
"Here, we have assigned the password as saurabh. Also note that 0 here means the password followed is clear text (non-hashed) . Now, we will create a local user name saurabh and associated this user with configured level. Enable aaa model and assign default list to various lines."
"Now, whenever username Saurabh will take remote access through vty lines, he will be assigned privilege level 8. Creating views: Role-Based CLI access enables the administrator to create different views of the device for different users. Each view defines the commands that a user can access. It is similar to privilege levels. Role-based CLI provides 2 types of views:"
"Note – It is necessary to apply a password to any view before configuring it. Also, here instead of a secret password, enable password can be used but it is less secure as it is not encrypted. We can check the configuration by:"
"Advantages of Role-based Access ControlThere are different advantages to utilizing RBAC, including:"
"1.Working on functional proficiency:- With RBAC, organizations can diminish the requirement for administrative work and secret word changes when they recruit new representatives or switch the jobs of existing representatives. RBAC allows associations rapidly to add and change jobs, as well as carry out them across stages, working frameworks (OSes) and applications. It likewise eliminates the potential for blunder while allocating client consents. Also, with RBAC, organizations can all the more effectively incorporate outsider clients into their organizations by giving them predefined jobs."
"2.Upgrading consistence:- Each association should conform to nearby, state and government guidelines. Organizations for the most part really like to carry out RBAC frameworks to meet the administrative and legal necessities for secrecy and protection since leaders and IT offices can all the more actually oversee how the information is gotten to and utilized. This is especially significant for monetary establishments and medical organizations that oversee delicate information."
"3.Giving chairmen expanded perceivability:- RBAC gives network overseers and administrators greater perceivability and oversight into the business, while likewise ensuring approved clients and visitors on the framework are just given admittance to what they need to take care of their responsibilities.Lessening costs:- By not permitting client admittance to specific cycles and applications, organizations might ration or more expense successfully use assets, like organization data transmission, memory and capacity."
"4.Diminishing gamble of breaks and information spillage:- Executing RBAC implies confining admittance to delicate data, consequently lessening the potential for information breaks or information spillage."
"Data link layer is responsible for something called Framing, which is the division of a stream of bits from the network layer into manageable units (called frames). Each frame consists of the sender’s address and a destination address. The destination address defines where the packet is to go and the sender’s address helps the recipient acknowledge the receipt. Frames could be fixed size or variable size. In fixed-size framing, there is no need for defining the boundaries of the frames as the size itself can be used to define the end of the frame and the beginning of the next frame. But, in variable-size framing, we need a way to define the end of the frame and the beginning of the next frame. To separate one frame from the next, an 8-bit (or 1-byte) flag is added at the beginning and the end of a frame. But the problem with that is, any pattern used for the flag could also be part of the information. So, there are two ways to overcome this problem:"
"Byte stuffing is a byte (usually escape character(ESC)), which has a predefined bit pattern is added to the data section of the frame when there is a character with the same pattern as the flag. Whenever the receiver encounters the ESC character, it removes it from the data section and treats the next character as data, not a flag. But the problem arises when the text contains one or more escape characters followed by a flag. To solve this problem, the escape characters that are part of the text are marked by another escape character i.e., if the escape character is part of the text, an extra one is added to show that the second one is part of the text."
"Bit stuffing – Mostly flag is a special 8-bit pattern “01111110” used to define the beginning and the end of the frame. Problem with the flag is the same as that was in the case of byte stuffing. So, in this protocol what we do is, if we encounter 0 and five consecutive 1 bits, an extra 0 is added after these bits. This extra stuffed bit is removed from the data by the receiver. The extra bit is added after one 0 followed by five 1 bits regardless of the value of the next bit. Also, as the sender side always knows which sequence is data and which is flag it will only add this extra bit in the data sequence, not in the flag sequence."
"Byte stuffing: It is used to convert a message format of a sequence of bytes that may contain reserved values into another byte sequence that does not contain reserved values. It is also known as character-oriented framing. Here, a special byte is stuffed before flag and esc also that special byte is escape(ESC)."
"Bit stuffing: It is used for inserting one or more non-information bits into a message to be transmitted, to break message sequence for synchronization. It is also known as bit-oriented framing. Here,0 bit stuffed after five consecutive 1 bits.i.e extra bit is added after five consecutive ones."
Hamming code is a set of error-correction codes that can be used to detect and correct the errors that can occur when the data is moved or stored from the sender to the receiver. It is a technique developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction. Redundant bits – Redundant bits are extra binary bits that are generated and added to the information-carrying bits of data transfer to ensure that no bits were lost during the data transfer. The number of redundant bits can be calculated using the following formula:
"Suppose the number of data bits is 7, then the number of redundant bits can be calculated using: = 2^4 ≥ 7 + 4 + 1 Thus, the number of redundant bits= 4 Parity bits.  A parity bit is a bit appended to a data of binary bits to ensure that the total number of 1’s in the data is even or odd. Parity bits are used for error detection. There are two types of parity bits:"
General Algorithm of Hamming code: Hamming Code is simply the use of extra parity bits to allow the identification of an error.
Determining the position of redundant bits – These redundancy bits are placed at positions that correspond to the power of 2.
"Error detection and correction: Suppose in the above example the 6th bit is changed from 0 to 1 during data transmission, then it gives new parity values in the binary number:"
For all the parity bits we will check the number of 1’s in their respective bit positions.
"For R1: bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. We can see that the number of 1’s in these bit positions are 4 and that’s even so we get a 0 for this."
"For R2: bits 2,3,6,7,10,11 . We can see that the number of 1’s in these bit positions are 5 and that’s odd so we get a 1 for this."
"For R4: bits 4, 5, 6, 7 . We can see that the number of 1’s in these bit positions are 3 and that’s odd so we get a 1 for this."
"For R8: bit 8,9,10,11 . We can see that the number of 1’s in these bit positions are 2 and that’s even so we get a 0 for this."
"The bits give the binary number 0110 whose decimal representation is 6. Thus, bit 6 contains an error. To correct the error the 6th bit is changed from 1 to 0."
Error Detection and Correction: Hamming code is designed to detect and correct single-bit errors that may occur during the transmission of data. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender.
Redundancy: Hamming code uses redundant bits to add additional information to the data being transmitted. This redundancy allows the recipient to detect and correct errors that may have occurred during transmission.
Efficiency: Hamming code is a relatively simple and efficient error-correction technique that does not require a lot of computational resources. This makes it ideal for use in low-power and low-bandwidth communication networks.
"Widely Used: Hamming code is a widely used error-correction technique and is used in a variety of applications, including telecommunications, computer networks, and data storage systems."
"Single Error Correction: Hamming code is capable of correcting a single-bit error, which makes it ideal for use in applications where errors are likely to occur due to external factors such as electromagnetic interference."
"Limited Multiple Error Correction: Hamming code can only correct a limited number of multiple errors. In applications where multiple errors are likely to occur, more advanced error-correction techniques may be required."
"OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization’, in the year 1984. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe."
"The OSI model, created in 1984 by ISO, is a reference framework that explains the process of transmitting data between computers. It is divided into seven layers that work together to carry out specialised network functions, allowing for a more systematic approach to networking."
The OSI model consists of seven abstraction layers arranged in a top-down order:
"The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together."
"The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of the DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:"
The packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of the NIC(Network Interface Card). DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.
The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the destination host will reply with its MAC address.
"The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer."
The transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.
"At the sender’s side: The transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Segmentation, and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data transmission. It also adds Source and Destination port numbers in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer."
1. Connection-Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process that includes
"In this type of transmission, the receiving device sends an acknowledgment, back to the source after a packet or group of packets is received. This type of transmission is reliable and secure."
"2. Connectionless service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer. In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a packet. This approach allows for much faster communication between devices. Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service."
"This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, and authentication, and also ensures security."
"Let us consider a scenario where a user wants to send a message through some Messenger application running in his browser. The “Messenger” here acts as the application layer which provides the user with an interface to create the data. This message or so-called Data is compressed, encrypted (if any secure data), and converted into bits (0’s and 1’s) so that it can be transmitted."
The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.
"At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user."
"Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit, is established between two devices before data transmission begins. The circuit remains dedicated to the communication for the duration of the session, and no other devices can use it while the session is in progress. Circuit switching is commonly used in voice communication and some types of data communication."
"Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network. Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, as well as other information needed for routing. The packets may take different paths to reach their destination, and they may be transmitted out of order or delayed due to network congestion."
"In conclusion, circuit switching and packet switching are two different methods used in communication networks to transfer data between two or more devices. Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path before data transmission begins, while packet switching divides the data into smaller units called packets and transmits them over the network. Understanding the differences between the two methods can help you choose the right network technology for your specific needs."
"Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) – The CSMA method does not tell us what to do in case there is a collision. Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) adds to the CSMA algorithm to deal with the collision. In CSMA/CD, the size of a frame must be large enough so that collision can be detected by the sender while sending the frame. So, the frame transmission delay must be at least two times the maximum propagation delay. Assume some station transmitted data packet and successfully get to the destination but it is just the Best Case, so we have to take the Worst Case scenario in which there will be contention slots. Contention slots are those slots that are not able to transmit their journey due to the collision. Suppose station A transmitted data but collide and the worst-case time wasted is 2Tp and then some station B found out a way to transmit the data so it took (As shown in Figure)"
"Now we don’t know how many contention slots, so we consider the worst-case to be of n contention slots."
"In CSMA/CD, for success, only 1 station should transmit while others shouldn’t. Let p be the probability to transmit data successfully."
"For max P(success), differentiate with respect to p and equate to zero (to get maxima and minima)."
Number of times we need to try before getting 1st success
"Here number of times we need to try (C) = e. Put a = Tt/Tp and divide by T in Efficiency = Tt / (C* 2 * Tp + Tt + Tp) We get,"
GATE CS Corner Questions Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. All questions have been asked in GATE in previous years or in GATE Mock Tests. It is highly recommended that you practice them.
"Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) is a popular standard for token passing LANs. In a token bus LAN, the physical media is a bus or a tree, and a logical ring is created using a coaxial cable. The token is passed from one user to another in a sequence (clockwise or anticlockwise). Each station knows the address of the station to its “left” and “right” as per the sequence in the logical ring. A station can only transmit data when it has the token. The working of a token bus is somewhat similar to Token Ring."
"The Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) is a standard for deploying token rings in LANs over a virtual ring. The physical medium uses coaxial cables and has a bus or tree architecture. The nodes/stations form a virtual ring, and the token is transmitted from one node to the next in a sequence along the virtual ring. Each node knows the address of the station before it and the station after it. When a station has the token, it can only broadcast data. The token bus works in a similar way as the Token Ring."
The above diagram shows a logical ring formed in a bus-based token-passing LAN. The logical ring is shown with the arrows.
"Here are, some of the advantages and disadvantages of Token Bus are:"
"Overall, Token Bus has some advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific requirements of the network. It is suitable for use in some situations where reliability and deterministic behavior are important, but may not be the best choice for high-speed, high-bandwidth applications."
"Token Ring protocol is a communication protocol used in Local Area Network (LAN). In a token ring protocol, the topology of the network is used to define the order in which stations send. The stations are connected to one another in a single ring. It uses a special three-byte frame called a “token” that travels around a ring. It makes use of Token Passing controlled access mechanism. Frames are also transmitted in the direction of the token. This way they will circulate around the ring and reach the station which is the destination."
Ring Latency – The time taken by a single bit to travel around the ring is known as ring latency.
"Where, d = length of the ring v = velocity of data in ring N = no. of stations in ring b = time taken by each station to hold the bit before transmitting it (bit delay) Converting N*b into sec –"
Cycle Time – The time taken by the token to complete one revolution of the ring is known as cycle time.
"Token Holding Time (THT) – The maximum time a token frame can be held by a station is known as THT, by default it is set to 10msec. No station can hold the token beyond THT. Calculating THT:"
"Station 1: Receives the token and transmits data D1 and then, releases the token. Station 2: Receives D1 (puts it onto the other end) and the token and then, transmits data D2 and releases the token. Station 3: Receives D1 –> transmits D1 Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives token –> transmits D3 Releases token. Station 4: Receives D1 –> transmits D1 Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives D3 –> transmits D3 Receives token –> transmits D4 Releases token. Station 1: Receives D1 –> discards D1 as D1 has completed its journey Receives D2 –> transmits D2 Receives D3 –> transmits D3 Receives D4 –> transmits D4 Receives token –> transmits D1(new) Releases token. (and the cycle continues so on…..) In this case,"
"Efficiency – Efficiency, e = useful time/ total time useful time = N*Tt total time = cycle time = Tp + (THT*N) So, e = (N*Tt)/(Tp + (THT*N)) 1. Delayed token reinsertion – In this case, THT = Tt + Tp So, cycle time = Tp + N*(Tt + Tp)"
"2. Early token reinsertion – In this case, THT = Tt So, cycle time = Tp + N*(Tt)"
"Multiplexing means multiple sources but one link. An alternative approach is a Direct Point to point-to-point connection but it has several problems as it requires an I/O port for each device, a need line for each device, and also a large amount of wiring needed if on different floors. Instead, if we use a multiplexer approach then all devices are connected to MUX and one line to the host, the link carries multiple channels of information and several lines equal to the number of lines out."
"Multiplexing is the sharing of a medium or bandwidth. It is the process in which multiple signals coming from multiple sources are combined and transmitted over a single communication/physical line. Multiplexing in computer networks is done using a device Multiplexer called MUX that takes ‘n’ input lines to generate a single output line. On the other hand, there is a device called DEMUX(Demultiplexer) that takes a single input line and generates ‘n’ output lines."
"The ‘n’ input lines shown above are transmitted via a multiplexer and it combines the signals to form a composite signal. Now, these signals are passed through DEMUX and it transfers those signals to their respective destinations."
"The frequency spectrum is divided among the logical channels and each user has exclusive access to his channel. It sends signals in several distinct frequency ranges and carries multiple video channels on a single cable. Each signal is modulated onto a different carrier frequency and carrier frequencies are separated by guard bands. The bandwidth of the transmission medium exceeds the required bandwidth of all the signals. Usually, for frequency division multiplexing analog signaling is used in order to transmit the signals, i.e. more susceptible to noise. Assignment of non-overlapping frequency ranges to each user or signal on a medium. Thus, all signals are transmitted at the same time, each using different frequencies."
The multiplexer is attached to the high-speed communication line. The frequency spectrum is divided up among the logical channels where each user hangs onto a particular frequency. The radio spectrum is an example of the media and the mechanism for extracting information from the medium.
"Each user periodically gets the entire bandwidth for a small burst of time, i.e. entire channel is dedicated to one user but only for a short period of time. It is very extensively used in computer communication and telecommunication. Sharing of the channel is accomplished by dividing available transmission time on a medium among users. It exclusively uses Digital Signaling instead of dividing the cable into frequency bands. TDM splits cable usage into time slots. The data rate of transmission media exceeds the data rate of signals. Uses a frame and one slot for each slice of time and the time slots are transmitted whether the source has data or not."
There are two types of TDMs which are as follows:
"Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing: It is synchronous because the multiplexer and the de-multiplexer have to agree on the time slots. The original time-division multiplexing. The multiplexer accepts input from attached devices in a round-robin fashion and transmits the data in a never-ending pattern. Some common examples of this are T-1 and ISDN telephone lines. If one device generates data at a faster rate than other devices, then the multiplexor must either sample the incoming data stream from that device more often than it samples the other devices or buffers the faster incoming stream. If a device has nothing to transmit, the multiplexor must still insert a piece of data from that device into the multiplexed stream."
"Statistical Time Division Multiplexing: It is a time-division but on-demand rather than fixed, rescheduling links on a per-packet basis and packets from different sources interleaved on the link. It allows the connection of more nodes to the circuit than the capacity of the circuit. Works on the premise that not all the nodes will transmit at full capacity at all times. It must transmit a terminal identification i.e destination id no. and may require storage. A statistical multiplexer transmits only the data from active workstations. If a workstation is not active, no space is wasted on the multiplexed stream. It accepts the incoming data streams and creates a frame containing only the data to be transmitted."
"Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing: It is a type of multiplexing, where the rate of sampling is different and also does not require a general clock, it is called Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing. Asynchronous TDMs have generally low bandwidth. In case when there is nothing to transmit, this type of TDM gives its time slot to other devices."
"Interleaving Time Division Multiplexing: Interleaving TDM can be taken as two switches rotating at high speed, one on the multiplexing and the other on the demultiplexing surface. These switches can also be rotated in the reverse direction. At once, when it leaves the surface of multiplexing and releases at the surface of de-multiplexer, it is called Interleaving."
"It is the same as FDM but applied to fibers, only the difference is that here the operating frequencies are much higher actually they are in the optical range. There’s great potential for fibers since the bandwidth is so huge. Fibers with different energy bands are passed through a diffraction grating prism. Combined on the long-distance link and then split at the destination. It has got high reliability and very high capacity."
It multiplexes multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic line. Different wavelength lasers(called lambdas) transmit multiple signals. Each signal carried on the fiber can be transmitted at a different rate from the other signals.
There are some more types of multiplexing that are discussed here.
"It is a type of multiplexing where each code is distributed among different spectrums so that each one of them can work at the same time simultaneously. It is also called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). CDMA makes use of spectrum technology along with analog-to-digital conversion(ADC). It is thus used by various radio communication technologies. Mainly, it is used for mobile communication."
"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital communication technique initially developed for use in cable television systems. OFDM is similar to the broadcasting technique known as frequency division multiplexing (also known as FDM), which uses a multitude of transmitters and receivers to send information on different frequencies over a single wire, such as an electrical power cable."
Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) is the combination of Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). It basically means that a particular channel is used against a particular frequency band for some time.
"Q.1: Let us consider a statistical time division multiplexing of packets. The number of sources is 10. In a time unit, a source transmits a packet of 1000 bits. The number of sources sending data for the first 20 time units is 6, 9, 3, 7, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 10, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 2, 9, 5 respectively. The output capacity of multiplexer is 5000 bits per time unit. Then the average number of backlogged of packets per time unit during the given period is [GATE IT 2007]."
"For detailed explanation, refer to GATE | Gate IT 2007 | Question 60."
"The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people to communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. It was created in the 1960s by the US Department of Defense as a way to connect computers and share information between researchers and scientists."
"The World Wide Web, or simply the web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources, linked together by hyperlinks and URLs. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a way for scientists to share information more easily. The web quickly grew to become the most popular way to access information on the internet."
"Together, the internet and the web have revolutionized the way we communicate, do business, and access information. They have made it possible for people all over the world to connect with each other instantly and have transformed many industries, from media and entertainment to education and healthcare."
"1. The Internet: In simplest terms, the Internet is a global network comprised of smaller networks that are interconnected using standardized communication protocols. The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite. This model divides methods into a layered system of protocols."
"The Internet provides a variety of information and communication facilities; contains forums, databases, email, hypertext, etc. It consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 2. The World Wide Web: The Web is the only way to access information through the Internet. It’s a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language”, which supports a number of features including links and multimedia. These documents are interlinked using hypertext links and are accessible via the Internet."
"URI: URI stands for ‘Uniform Resource Identifier’. A URI can be a name, locator, or both for an online resource whereas a URL is just the locator. URLs are a subset of URIs.  A URL is a human-readable text that was designed to replace the numbers (IP addresses) that computers use to communicate with servers."
"A URL consists of a protocol, domain name, and path (which includes the specific subfolder structure where a page is located) like-"
"The Internet is not governed and has no single authority figure. The ultimate authority for where the Internet is going rests with the Internet Society, or ISOC. ISOC is a voluntary membership organization whose purpose is to promote global information exchange through Internet technology."
This method was developed to decrease the chances of collisions when two or more stations start sending their signals over the data link layer. Carrier Sense multiple access requires that each station first check the state of the medium before sending.
The persistence methods can be applied to help the station take action when the channel is busy/idle.
"In this method, a station monitors the medium after it sends a frame to see if the transmission was successful. If successful, the transmission is finished, if not, the frame is sent again."
"In the diagram, starts sending the first bit of its frame at t1 and since C sees the channel idle at t2, starts sending its frame at t2. C detects A’s frame at t3 and aborts transmission. A detects C’s frame at t4 and aborts its transmission. Transmission time for C’s frame is, therefore, t3-t2         and for A’s frame is t4-t1          So, the frame transmission time (Tfr) should be at least twice the maximum propagation time (Tp). This can be deduced when the two stations involved in a collision are a maximum distance apart. Process: The entire process of collision detection can be explained as follows:"
Throughput and Efficiency: The throughput of CSMA/CD is much greater than pure or slotted ALOHA.
"The basic idea behind CSMA/CA is that the station should be able to receive while transmitting to detect a collision from different stations. In wired networks, if a collision has occurred then the energy of the received signal almost doubles, and the station can sense the possibility of collision. In the case of wireless networks, most of the energy is used for transmission, and the energy of the received signal increases by only 5-10% if a collision occurs. It can’t be used by the station to sense collision. Therefore CSMA/CA has been specially designed for wireless networks. These are three types of strategies:"
"Overall, CSMA/CA balances the need for efficient use of the shared channel with the need to avoid collisions, leading to reliable and fair communication in a wireless network."
Process: The entire process of collision avoidance can be explained as follows:
There are 4 types of access modes available in CSMA. It is also referred as 4 different types of CSMA protocols which decide the time to start sending data across shared media.
"CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Detection) is a media access control method that was widely used in Early Ethernet technology/LANs when there used to be shared Bus Topology and each node ( Computers) were connected By Coaxial Cables. Now a Days Ethernet is Full Duplex and Topology is either Star (connected via Switch or Router) or Point to Point ( Direct Connection). Hence CSMA/CD is not used but they are still supported though. Consider a scenario where there are ‘n’ stations on a link and all are waiting to transfer data through that channel. In this case, all ‘n’ stations would want to access the link/channel to transfer their own data. The problem arises when more than one station transmits the data at the moment. In this case, there will be collisions in the data from different stations. CSMA/CD is one such technique where different stations that follow this protocol agree on some terms and collision detection measures for effective transmission. This protocol decides which station will transmit when so that data reaches the destination without corruption. How CSMA/CD works?"
"Consider the above situation. Two stations, A & B. Propagation Time: Tp = 1 hr ( Signal takes 1 hr to go from A to B)"
"After the collision occurs, a collision signal is generated and sent to both A & B to inform the stations about the collision. Since the collision happened midway, the collision signal also takes 30 minutes to reach A & B."
"This collision signal is received by all the stations on that link. Then, How to ensure that it is our station’s data that collided? For this, Transmission time (Tt) > Propagation Time (Tp) [Rough bound] This is because we want that before we transmit the last bit of our data from our station, we should at least be sure that some of the bits have already reached their destination. This ensures that the link is not busy and collisions will not occur. But, above is a loose bound. We have not taken the time taken by the collision signal to travel back to us. For this consider the worst-case scenario."
"This collision occurs just before the data reaches B. Now the collision signal takes 59:59 minutes again to reach A. Hence, A receives the collision information approximately after 2 hours, that is, after 2 * Tp."
This is the maximum collision time that a system can take to detect if the collision was of its own data.
What should be the minimum length of the packet to be transmitted?
Padding helps in cases where we do not have such long packets. We can pad extra characters to the end of our data to satisfy the above condition.
"Multiplexing is used in cases where the signals of lower bandwidth and the transmitting media is having higher bandwidth. In this case, the possibility of sending a number of signals is more. In this, the signals are combined into one and are sent over a link that has greater bandwidth of media than the communicating nodes."
"In this, a number of signals are transmitted at the same time, and each source transfers its signals in the allotted frequency range. There is a suitable frequency gap between the 2 adjacent signals to avoid over-lapping. Since the signals are transmitted in the allotted frequencies so this decreases the probability of collision. The frequency spectrum is divided into several logical channels, in which every user feels that they possess a particular bandwidth. A number of signals are sent simultaneously at the same time allocating separate frequency bands or channels to each signal. It is used in radio and TV transmission. Therefore to avoid interference between two successive channels Guard bands are used."
"This happens when the data transmission rate of media is greater than that of the source, and each signal is allotted a definite amount of time. These slots are so small that all transmissions appear to be parallel. In frequency division multiplexing all the signals operate at the same time with different frequencies, but in time-division multiplexing, all the signals operate with the same frequency at different times."
"The time slots are pre-assigned and fixed. This slot is even given if the source is not ready with data at this time. In this case, the slot is transmitted empty. It is used for multiplexing digitized voice streams."
"The slots are allocated dynamically depending on the speed of the source or their ready state. It dynamically allocates the time slots according to different input channels’ needs, thus saving the channel capacity."
"Efficient Use of Bandwidth: FDM allows multiple signals to be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can lead to more efficient use of available bandwidth.No Time Synchronization Required: FDM does not require precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it easier to implement.Low Implementation Cost: FDM is a relatively simple technique that does not require sophisticated hardware or software, making it less expensive to implement."
"Limited Capacity: FDM is limited in terms of the number of signals that can be transmitted over a single communication channel, which can be a disadvantage in applications where a large number of signals need to be transmitted.Interference: FDM can be susceptible to interference from other signals transmitted on nearby frequencies, which can degrade the quality of the transmitted signals.Difficulty in Assigning Frequencies: FDM requires careful assignment of frequencies to different signals to avoid interference, which can be a complex and time-consuming process."
"High Capacity: TDM can support a large number of signals over a single communication channel, making it ideal for applications where many signals need to be transmitted.Simple Implementation: TDM is a relatively simple technique that is easy to implement, making it a cost-effective solution for many applications.Precise Time Synchronization: TDM requires precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, which can help ensure accurate transmission of signals."
"Inefficient Use of Bandwidth: TDM may not make optimal use of available bandwidth, as time slots may be left unused if there are no signals to transmit during a particular time slot.High Implementation Cost: TDM requires sophisticated hardware or software to ensure precise time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving devices, making it more expensive to implement than FDM.Vulnerable to Timing Jitter: TDM can be vulnerable to timing jitter, which can occur when the timing of the transmitting and receiving devices drifts out of sync, leading to errors in the transmission of signals."
"A wireless local area network (LAN) node that provides internet connection and virtual private network (VPN) access from a given location for users of devices with wireless connectivity is a Hot Spot. Nowadays hot spots are common in airports, libraries, hotels, coffee shops, etc. A user can connect to a hot spot manually by checking the wireless connection options then selecting one of them and entering authentication information which is usually a simple password. The establishment that owns the Hot Spot determines the range of the wireless router whose radius generally is about 100 to 200 meters. Hot Spot 2.0 (HS 2.0), also called Wi-Fi Certified Passpoint is the new standard for public-access Wi-Fi. It enables seamless roaming among WiFi networks and between WiFi and cellular networks. Wi-Fi Alliance developed the HS 2.0. The Wireless Broadband Association enabled it to provide seamless hand-off of traffic without requiring additional user sign-on and authentication. The HS 2.0 specification is based on a set of protocols called 802.11u. These protocols facilitate cellular-like roaming, increased bandwidth, and service on demand for wireless-equipped devices in general. When an 802.11u-capable device is in range of at least one Wi-Fi network, the device automatically selects a network and connects to it if the authentication to the network is done once before. Network discovery, registration, provisioning, and access processes are automated so that the user does not have to go through them manually in order to connect and stay connected. Benefits of Hotspot 2.0 Networks: Hotspot 2.0 networks provide cellular-style roaming for Wi-Fi networks. When you move around the world, your device will connect you to available public hotspots automatically. There are a few benefits to this:"
"Hotspot 2.0 provides a more seamless and secure Wi-Fi experience for users, particularly in public spaces where multiple networks may be available."
There are two kinds of network Adapters. A wired adapter allows us to set up a connection to a modem or router via Ethernet in a computer whereas a wireless adapter identifies and connects to remote hot spots. Each adapter has a distinct label known as a MAC address which recognizes and authenticates the computer. Mac address is shown in the format of 00:00:00:00:00:00 or 00-00-00-00-00-00.
"MAC filtering is a security method based on access control. In this, each address is assigned a 48-bit address which is used to determine whether we can access a network or not. It helps in listing a set of allowed devices that you need on your Wi-Fi and the list of denied devices that you don’t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. In a way, we can deny list or allow a list of certain computers based on their MAC address. We can configure the filter to allow connection only to those devices included in the white list. White lists provide greater security than denied lists because the router grants access only to selected devices."
"It is used on enterprise wireless networks having multiple access points to prevent clients from communicating with each other. The access point can be configured to only allow clients to talk to the default gateway, but not other wireless clients. It increases the efficiency of access to a network The router allows configuring a list of allowed MAC addresses in its web interface, allowing you to choose which devices can connect to your network. The router has a number of functions designed to improve the security of the network but not all are useful. Media access control may seem advantageous but there are certain flaws. On a wireless network, the device with the proper credentials such as SSID and password can authenticate with the router and join the network which gets an IP address and access to the internet and any shared resources. MAC address filtering adds an extra layer of security that checks the device’s MAC address against a list of agreed addresses. If the client’s address matches one on the router’s list, access is granted otherwise it doesn’t join the network. Steps for Mac filtering –"
"For enabling a list of allowed, denied or both devices follow the steps given below."
Note that if MAC Filtering is enabled on a wireless router and the MAC address is not entered then the wireless device connected to the router will not be able to connect We do not need to enable MAC Filtering if this is already disabled for troubleshooting purposes. Router manufacturers are more knowledgeable in this field. What to Do –
"Security – By examining the packet using Wireshark hackers with a toolset like Kali Linux can access the network as they can get the MAC address of allowed devices and then they can change their device’s MAC address to the allowed MAC address and connect posing as that device. They can use “deauth”or “deassoc” attack that forcefully disconnects a device from a Wi-Fi network or use airplay-ng to send disassociation packets to the clients and then connect in the device’s place. However, MAC addresses of wireless clients can’t truly be changed because they’re encoded in the hardware. But some critics spotted that MAC addresses can be faked. All an attacker needs to do is to know one of the valid addresses. They don’t have to break the encryption to access your network or crack your WPA2 encrypted password. They just have to pretend to be a trusted computer. MAC filtering will prevent average hackers from gaining network access. Most computer users don’t know how to trick their MAC address let alone find a router’s list of approved addresses. Unlike domain filter, they do not stop traffic from flowing through the network. A general doubt that arises is how the hackers can get our MAC address if they can’t connect to the network. It is a weakness of Wi-Fi that even if there is a WPA2 encrypted network, the MAC addresses on those packets are not encrypted. This means that anyone with network sniffing software installed and a wireless card in a range of your network can easily grab all the MAC addresses that are communicating with your router."
"Hypothetically, the probability of halting pernicious organization action increments when a switch really looks at this association prior to conceding gadgets. Yet, by dissecting the parcel utilizing Wireshark, programmers utilizing a toolset, for example, Kali Linux can get to the organization since they can get the Macintosh locations of supported gadgets, then, at that point, the aggressor can change its gadget’s Macintosh address to the permitted Macintosh address and interface by taking on the appearance of that gadget. They can utilize the “deauth” or “deassoc” assaults, which powerfully segregate a gadget from a Wi-Fi organization, or they can use airplay-ng, which sends disassociation bundles to clients and afterward interfaces in the gadget’s place."
"Then again, the Macintosh locations of remote clients can’t be changed on the grounds that they are encoded in the equipment. Notwithstanding, a few pundits have brought up that Macintosh locations can be manufactured. An aggressor just needs to know one of the real locations. They don’t have to break the encryption or break your WPA2 scrambled secret phrase to get sufficiently close to your organization. The assailants need to act like a confided in PC."
"A typical inquiry emerges to you that how these programmers got our Macintosh address assuming that they couldn’t interface with the organization. Regardless of whether there is a WPA2 scrambled network, the Macintosh tends to on those bundles are not encoded. This implies that anybody having network sniffing programming and a remote card close enough to your organization can undoubtedly catch all of the Macintosh tends to converse with your switch."
"VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a concept in which we divide the broadcast domain into smaller broadcast domains logically at layer 2. If we create different VLANs then by default, a host from one VLAN can communicate with all the hosts residing in the same VLAN. If we want some hosts not able to reach other hosts within the same VLAN, then the concept of VLAN Access-list or Private VLAN can be used. (Access-list, is a set of various permit or deny conditions, used for packet filtering) VLAN ACL (VACL) –"
"VLAN ACL is used to filter traffic of a VLAN (traffic within a VLAN i.e traffic for destination host residing in the same VLAN). All packets entering the VLAN are checked against the VACL. Unlike Router ACL, VACL is not defined in a direction but it is possible to filter traffic based on the direction of the traffic by combining VACLs and Private VLAN features. Procedure –"
"1. Security: VACLs can be utilized to control admittance to explicit VLANs, forestalling unapproved admittance to delicate organization assets. For instance, you can utilize a VACL to impede all traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, with the exception of approved clients."
"2. Filtering: VACLs can be utilized to channel traffic in view of explicit models, for example, IP address or port number. This can assist with decreasing organization clog by restricting how much undesirable traffic on the organization."
"3. Monitoring: VACLs can be utilized to screen network traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, giving perceivability into network movement. For instance, you can utilize a VACL to log all traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, making it conceivable to recognize potential security dangers or investigate network issues."
"4. QoS: VACLs can be utilized to focus on network traffic entering or leaving a VLAN, guaranteeing that basic traffic gets the important data transfer capacity and diminishing the probability of blockage."
"There is a switch named switch1 which is connected to 3 routers named Router1 (IP address-192.168.1.1/24), Router2 (IP address-192.168.1.2/24), and Router3 (IP address-192.168.1.3/24) as shown in the figure."
"In this task, we will deny traffic from Router1 to Router3 using VACL."
Configuring access-list on switch1 stating that all IP traffic should be allowed from host 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3
"Now, configuring the VLAN access-map which states that match the IP address defined in access-list and take action of drop (which means traffic should not be allowed from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3)."
"In the first command, 10 is the sequence number of the access map. If we do not define any sequence number then it will automatically take 10 as a sequence number. Now, for the traffic from Router1 (192.168.1.1) to Router3 (192.168.1.3), the traffic will be dropped but what about the traffic from Router2 to Router3?"
"The traffic from Router2 to Router3 will also get drop because no action is defined for this traffic (implicit deny). Therefore, we have to define another rule stating that the other traffic should be allowed."
"In the first command, 20 is the sequence number which means this rule will be checked after the first rule having sequence number 10."
"At last, we will assign this access-map, named My_access_list, to a VLAN (here VLAN 1)"
"This command will display the access map. This will display the name of the access-map, sequence number of the rule, and the access-list name (that has been used)."
This will display the VLANs which are filtered by the VLAN access map.
"For a specific purpose if things are connected together, are referred to as a NETWORK. A network can be of many types, like a telephone network, television network, computer network, or even a people network. Similarly, a COMPUTER NETWORK is also a kind of setup, where it connects two or more devices to share a range of services and information in the form of e-mails and messages, databases, documents, websites, audios and videos, telephone calls, and video conferences, etc. among them. A PROTOCOL is nothing but a set of defined rules, which has to be followed by every connected device across a network to communicate and share information among them. To facilitates End to End communication, a number of protocols worked together to form Protocol Suites or Stacks."
"Network: A collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, that can communicate with each other."
"Node: Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or router."
Protocol: A set of rules and standards that define how devices on a network communicate with each other.
"IP Address: A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to identify and communicate with other devices."
Router: A networking device that connects multiple networks together and forwards data packets between them.
Switch: A networking device that connects devices on a network and forwards data packets between them.
"Firewall: A security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, based on a set of predefined security rules."
"DNS (Domain Name System): A system that translates domain names (such as www.example.com) into IP addresses, allowing devices to locate and connect to websites and other network resources."
"LAN (Local Area Network): A network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building."
"WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that connects devices over a large geographical area, such as multiple offices in different cities or countries."

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): A set of protocols used to communicate over the internet and other networks.
"These are just a few basic networking terms, but understanding them is essential to building a strong foundation in computer networking.Some basic Protocols are:"
"The Network reference models were developed to allow products from different manufacturers to interoperate on a network. A network reference model serves as a blueprint, detailing standards for how protocol communication should occur. The most widely recognized reference models are the Open Systems Interconnect ( OSI ) Model and Department of Defense ( DoD, also known as TCP/IP ) model."
An Internetwork is a general term describing multiple networks connected together. The Internet is the largest and most well-known internetwork.
"VLANs are used to divide broadcast domain at layer 2. By default, all the switch ports are in VLAN 1. Configuration of VLANs other than VLAN 1 then to carry traffic of these VLANs, user has to make a switch port trunk which is connected to another switch. If the frame is forwarded out to an access link then it is considered that the frame belongs to the VLAN which is configured on that switch port. But if the frame is forwarded out to a trunk link then how did the other device know that the traffic belongs to which VLAN? There comes the concept of VLAN identification methods. VLAN Identification methods – If the frame is forwarded out to a trunk link then a header or tag is added to the frame header which specifies the VLAN to which the frame belongs. The frame is encapsulated at the sender’s switch and removed at the receiver’s switch and then forwarded out to the ports which belongs to that VLAN (according to the processing of switch). There are 2 VLAN identification methods:"
"To communicate or transfer data from one computer to another, we need an address. In computer networks, various types of addresses are introduced; each works at a different layer. A MAC address, which stands for Media Access Control Address, is a physical address that works at the Data Link Layer. In this article, we will discuss addressing a DLL, which is the MAC Address."
"So, go through the article if you are eager to learn what is MAC address and its components."
"MAC Addresses are unique 48-bit hardware numbers of a computer that are embedded into a network card (known as a Network Interface Card) during manufacturing. The MAC Address is also known as the Physical Address of a network device. In the IEEE 802 standard, the data link layer is divided into two sublayers:"
The MAC address is used by the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data-Link Layer. MAC Address is worldwide unique since millions of network devices exist and we need to uniquely identify each.
"To understand what is MAC address is, it is very important that first you understand the format of the MAC Address. So a MAC Address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (6-bit binary number), which is mostly represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation."
"The First 6 digits (say 00:40:96) of the MAC Address identify the manufacturer, called the OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier). IEEE Registration Authority Committee assigns these MAC prefixes to its registered vendors."
"The rightmost six digits represent Network Interface Controller, which is assigned by the manufacturer."
"As discussed above, the MAC address is represented by Colon-Hexadecimal notation. But this is just a conversion, not mandatory. MAC address can be represented using any of the following formats:"
Note: Colon-Hexadecimal notation is used by Linux OS and Period-separated Hexadecimal notation is used by Cisco Systems.
"1. Unicast: A Unicast-addressed frame is only sent out to the interface leading to a specific NIC. If the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to zero, the frame is meant to reach only one receiving NIC. The MAC Address of the source machine is always Unicast."
"2. Multicast: The multicast address allows the source to send a frame to a group of devices. In Layer-2 (Ethernet) Multicast address, the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to one. IEEE has allocated the address block 01-80-C2-xx-xx-xx (01-80-C2-00-00-00 to 01-80-C2-FF-FF-FF) for group addresses for use by standard protocols."
"3. Broadcast: Similar to Network Layer, Broadcast is also possible on the underlying layer( Data Link Layer). Ethernet frames with ones in all bits of the destination address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) are referred to as the broadcast addresses. Frames that are destined with MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF will reach every computer belonging to that LAN segment."
"The reason for having both IP and MAC addresses lies in the way the Internet works, specifically in the structure of the OSI Model. This model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is sent and received over a network. It’s divided into seven layers, each performing specific functions."
"Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) uses a MAC (Media Access Control) address. These are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer. The primary function of MAC addresses is to manage how data is transported from one network node to another on a direct, physical basis – this is also referred to as “hop to hop” delivery."
"On the other hand, Layer 3 ( Network Layer ) uses an IP (Internet Protocol) address. These IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network and to route traffic between networks. The IP addresses ensure that the data gets from its original source reaches its final destination and it is also called “end-to-end” delivery of data."
"When a computer sends data, it first wraps it in an IP header, which includes the source and destination IP addresses. This IP header, along with the data, is then encapsulated in a MAC header, which includes the source and destination MAC addresses for the current “hop” in the path."
"As the data travels from one router to the next, the MAC address header is stripped off and a new one is generated for the next hop. However, the IP header, which was generated by the original computer, remains intact until it reaches the final destination. This process illustrates how the IP header manages the “end to end” delivery, while the MAC headers handle the “hop to hop” delivery."
"So, Both IP and MAC addresses are essential for the functioning of the Internet. While MAC addresses facilitate the direct, physical transfer of data between network nodes, IP addresses ensure that the data reaches its final destination."
"Consider a LAN (Local Area Network) as a large gathering where everyone is engaged in conversations. Now, let’s suppose that there are two individuals at this gathering who coincidentally share the same name. This scenario would inevitably create confusion, right? If someone calls out that name, both individuals would respond, making it challenging to discern the intended recipient of the message."
"In a similar manner, within a network, each device possesses a distinct identifier referred to as a MAC (Media Access Control) address. Think of it as a unique name assigned to the device. When information is transmitted across the network, it is directed to a specific MAC address, much like a letter being addressed to a specific individual."
"However, if multiple devices within the same network were to have identical MAC addresses, it would result in confusion and disrupt the network’s functioning. The network would struggle to ascertain which device should receive the transmitted information. To prevent this confusion and ensure the accurate delivery of information, it is vital for each device on a network to possess a unique MAC address."
"A MAC address is mostly used to configure a router for a network device or during troubleshooting.  The address of our computer device can be easily checked with any operating device. All the Apple devices connected to our home network contain a unique MAC address. Manufacturers may identify a MAC address by other names, such as the physical address, hardware ID, wireless ID, and Wi-Fi address."
Following are the steps which help to find MAC addresses for different OS
Here is the Step-by-Step guide to finding MAC addresses on Windows.

Here is a step-by-step guide to finding MAC addresses on a Mac operating system.
"Step 2 – In the system settings, click on the MAC network option."
Here is a step-by-step guide to finding MAC addresses on a Unix/Linux operating system.
"Some ISPs use MAC addresses to assign an IP address to the gateway device. When a device connects to the ISP, the DHCP server records the MAC address and then assigns an IP address. Now the system will be identified through the MAC address. When the device gets disconnected, it loses the IP address."
"If the user wants to reconnect, the DHCP server checks if the device is connected before. If so, then the server tries to assign the same IP address (in case the lease period has not expired). In case the user changed the router, the user has to inform the ISP about the new MAC address because the new MAC address is unknown to ISP, so the connection cannot be established."
"Or the other option is Cloning, user can simply clone the registered MAC address with ISP. Now router keeps reporting the old MAC addresses to ISP and there will be no connection issue."
The Media Access Control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to most network adapters or network interface cards (NICs) by the manufacturer for identification and use in the Media Access Control protocol sub-layer.
An Ethernet MAC address is a 48-bit binary value expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (4 bits per hexadecimal digit). MAC addresses are in a flat structure and thus they are not routable on the Internet. Serial interfaces do not use MAC addresses. It does NOT contain a network and host portion with the address. It is used to deliver the frame to the destination device.
"The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer systems that enables communication and the sharing of information across the world. The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and conduct business."
"Web programming refers to the development of web applications and websites that are accessed over the Internet. Web programming involves creating web pages, web applications, and other online content that can be displayed in a web browser."
"Web programming is accomplished using a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on the needs of the project."
"Web programming involves creating dynamic websites that are interactive and user-friendly. This includes the use of databases, server-side scripting, and client-side scripting to create applications that can process data, display content, and interact with users."
"The Internet is a vast network of computers, and servers, which communicate with each other. The internet connects the whole wide world together. The Internet is a vast network that connects billions of computers and other electronic devices all around the world. You can get nearly any information, communicate with anyone on the globe, and do a lot more with the Internet. All of this is possible by connecting a computer to the Internet, generally known as going online. When someone says a computer is online, they are simply referring to the fact that it is linked to the Internet. How does it actually work at a very low level? Client-side: First, when we type a URL like www.google.com, the browser converts it into a file containing:"
"Now this file is converted to binary code by the browser and it is sent down the wires if we are connected through Ethernet and if we are using WiFi, first it converts it to a radio signal which is decoded by a router in a very low level. It is converted to binary and then sent to the servers. This information or ‘binary codes’ go to the destination and respond if it is received by the sender only because of the IP address. One router will send the information to another and this keeps on going until the binary codes reach the destination. Server-side: Now the server receives the binary code and decodes it and sends the response in the following manner:"
"Now, this is converted back to binary by the server and sent to the IP address that is requesting it. Once the codes are received by the client, the browser again decodes the information in the following way:"
To understand the basic web terminology refer: The Internet and the Web
The Internet and web programming have a wide range of uses and applications. Here are some of the most common uses:
"Web programming plays a crucial role in enabling many of these applications. Web programming is used to create websites, online stores, web applications, and other online services that are accessed through the Internet. Web programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python are used to create these web-based applications."
Some of the most significant issues in Internet and web programming:
The OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components.
"TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model."
"The number of layers is sometimes referred to as five or four. Here In this article, we’ll study five layers. The Physical Layer and Data Link Layer are referred to as one single layer as the ‘Physical Layer’ or ‘Network Interface Layer’ in the 4-layer reference."
"The main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end."
"TCP and IP are different protocols of Computer Networks. The basic difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) is in the transmission of data. In simple words, IP finds the destination of the mail and TCP has the work to send and receive the mail. UDP is another protocol, which does not require IP to communicate with another computer. IP is required by only TCP. This is the basic difference between TCP and IP."
"Whenever we want to send something over the internet using the TCP/IP Model, the TCP/IP Model divides the data into packets at the sender’s end and the same packets have to be recombined at the receiver’s end to form the same data, and this thing happens to maintain the accuracy of the data. TCP/IP model divides the data into a 4-layer procedure, where the data first go into this layer in one order and again in reverse order to get organized in the same way at the receiver’s end."
"For more, you can refer to TCP/IP in Computer Networking."
The diagrammatic comparison of the TCP/IP and OSI model is as follows:
"It is a group of applications requiring network communications. This layer is responsible for generating the data and requesting connections. It acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver. During this article, we will be talking on the behalf of the receiver."
"The packet’s network protocol type, in this case, TCP/IP, is identified by the data-link layer. Error prevention and “framing” are also provided by the data-link layer. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) framing and Ethernet IEEE 802.2 framing are two examples of data-link layer protocols."
This layer parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols residing at this layer are as follows:
"The Internet Layer is a layer in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which is the set of protocols that define the Internet. The Internet Layer is responsible for routing packets of data from one device to another across a network. It does this by assigning each device a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and determine the route that packets should take to reach it."
"Example: Imagine that you are using a computer to send an email to a friend. When you click “send,” the email is broken down into smaller packets of data, which are then sent to the Internet Layer for routing. The Internet Layer assigns an IP address to each packet and uses routing tables to determine the best route for the packet to take to reach its destination. The packet is then forwarded to the next hop on its route until it reaches its destination. When all of the packets have been delivered, your friend’s computer can reassemble them into the original email message."
"In this example, the Internet Layer plays a crucial role in delivering the email from your computer to your friend’s computer. It uses IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best route for the packets to take, and it ensures that the packets are delivered to the correct destination. Without the Internet Layer, it would not be possible to send data across the Internet."
The TCP/IP transport layer protocols exchange data receipt acknowledgments and retransmit missing packets to ensure that packets arrive in order and without error. End-to-end communication is referred to as such. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol are transport layer protocols at this level (UDP).
This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The three main protocols present in this layer are:
The host-to-host layer is a layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that is responsible for providing communication between hosts (computers or other devices) on a network. It is also known as the transport layer.
"Example: Consider a network with two hosts, A and B. Host A wants to send a file to host B. The host-to-host layer in host A will break the file into smaller segments, add error correction and flow control information, and then transmit the segments over the network to host B. The host-to-host layer in host B will receive the segments, check for errors, and reassemble the file. Once the file has been transferred successfully, the host-to-host layer in host B will acknowledge receipt of the file to host A."
"In this example, the host-to-host layer is responsible for providing a reliable connection between host A and host B, breaking the file into smaller segments, and reassembling the segments at the destination. It is also responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing the data and providing end-to-end communication between the two hosts."
TCP/IP Model covers many Internet Protocols. The main rule of these Internet Protocols is how the data is validated and sent over the Internet. Some Common Internet Protocols include:
"A local Area Network (LAN) is a data communication network connecting various terminals or computers within a building or limited geographical area. The connection between the devices could be wired or wireless. Ethernet, Token rings, and Wireless LAN using IEEE 802.11 are examples of standard LAN technologies."
"Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology and is defined under IEEE standards 802.3. The reason behind its wide usability is that Ethernet is easy to understand, implement, and maintain, and allows low-cost network implementation. Also, Ethernet offers flexibility in terms of the topologies that are allowed. Ethernet generally uses a bus topology. Ethernet operates in two layers of the OSI model, the physical layer and the data link layer. For Ethernet, the protocol data unit is a frame since we mainly deal with DLLs. In order to handle collisions, the Access control mechanism used in Ethernet is CSMA/CD."
"Although Ethernet has been largely replaced by wireless networks, wired networking still uses Ethernet more frequently. Wi-Fi eliminates the need for cables by enabling users to connect their smartphones or laptops to a network wirelessly. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard offers faster maximum data transfer rates when compared to Gigabit Ethernet. However, wired connections are more secure and less susceptible to interference than wireless networks. This is the main justification for why so many companies and organizations continue to use Ethernet."
"Robert Metcalfe’s invention of Ethernet in 1973 completely changed computer networking. With Ethernet Version 2’s support for 10 Mbps and an initial data rate of 2.94 Mbps, it first gained popularity in 1982. Ethernet’s adoption was accelerated by the IEEE 802.3 standardization in 1983. Local area networks (LANs) and the internet were able to expand quickly thanks to the rapid evolution and advancement of Ethernet, which over time reached speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and higher. It evolved into the standard technology for wired network connections, enabling dependable and quick data transmission for private residences, commercial buildings, and data centers all over the world."
There are different types of Ethernet networks that are used to connect devices and transfer data.
"1. Fast Ethernet: This type of Ethernet network uses cables called twisted pair or CAT5. It can transfer data at a speed of around 100 Mbps (megabits per second). Fast Ethernet uses both fiber optic and twisted pair cables to enable communication. There are three categories of Fast Ethernet: 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, and 100BASE-T4."
"2. Gigabit Ethernet: This is an upgrade from Fast Ethernet and is more common nowadays. It can transfer data at a speed of 1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps (gigabit per second). Gigabit Ethernet also uses fiber optic and twisted pair cables for communication. It often uses advanced cables like CAT5e, which can transfer data at a speed of 10 Gbps."
"3.10-Gigabit Ethernet: This is an advanced and high-speed network that can transmit data at a speed of 10 gigabits per second. It uses special cables like CAT6a or CAT7 twisted-pair cables and fiber optic cables. With the help of fiber optic cables, this network can cover longer distances, up to around 10,000 meters."
"4. Switch Ethernet: This type of network involves using switches or hubs to improve network performance. Each workstation in this network has its own dedicated connection, which improves the speed and efficiency of data transfer. Switch Ethernet supports a wide range of speeds, from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps, depending on the version of Ethernet being used."
"In summary, Fast Ethernet is the basic version with a speed of 100 Mbps, Gigabit Ethernet is faster with a speed of 1 Gbps, 10-Gigabit Ethernet is even faster with a speed of 10 Gbps, and Switch Ethernet uses switches or hubs to enhance network performance."
"Using Manchester encoding, data can be transmitted over a physical medium in communication systems. It is a type of line coding where the signal transitions, as opposed to the absolute voltage levels, serve as the data representation."
"Each bit of information is split into two equal time periods, or “halves,” in Manchester encoding. If the signal level is higher during the first half of the bit period than it is during the second, the result is a logic high (typically 1), or vice versa."
"Since we are talking about IEEE 802.3 standard Ethernet, therefore, 0 is expressed by a high-to-low transition, a 1 by the low-to-high transition. In both Manchester Encoding and Differential Manchester, the Encoding Baud rate is double of bit rate."
"Speed: When compared to a wireless connection, Ethernet provides significantly more speed. Because Ethernet is a one-to-one connection, this is the case. As a result, speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) or even 100 Gigabits per second (Gbps) are possible."
"Efficiency: An Ethernet cable, such as Cat6, consumes less electricity, even less than a wifi connection. As a result, these ethernet cables are thought to be the most energy-efficient."
"Good data transfer quality: Because it is resistant to noise, the information transferred is of high quality."
"Ethernet LANs consist of network nodes and interconnecting media, or links."
"Data Terminal Equipment (DTE): Media, Generally, DTEs are the end devices that convert the user information into signals or reconvert the received signals. DTE devices are: personal computers, workstations, file servers or print servers also referred to as end stations. These devices are either the source or the destination of data frames. The data terminal equipment may be a single piece of equipment or multiple pieces of equipment that are interconnected and perform all the required functions to allow the user to communicate. A user can interact with DTE or DTE may be a user. Data Communication Equipment (DCE):- DCEs are the intermediate network devices that receive and forward frames across the network. They may be either standalone devices such as repeaters, network switches, or routers, or maybe communications interface units such as interface cards and modems. The DCE performs functions such as signal conversion, coding, and maybe a part of the DTE or intermediate equipment."
"Distance limitations: Ethernet has distance limitations, with the maximum cable length for a standard Ethernet network being 100 meters. This means that it may not be suitable for larger networks that require longer distances."
"Bandwidth sharing: Ethernet networks share bandwidth among all connected devices, which can result in reduced network speeds as the number of devices increases."
"Security vulnerabilities: Although Ethernet includes built-in security features, it is still vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access and data interception."
"Complexity: Ethernet networks can be complex to set up and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and expertise."
"Compatibility issues: While Ethernet is generally interoperable with other networking technologies, compatibility issues can arise when integrating with older or legacy systems."
"Cable installation: Ethernet networks require the installation of physical cables, which can be time-consuming and expensive to install."
"Physical limitations: Ethernet networks require physical connections between devices, which can limit mobility and flexibility in network design."
The Aloha protocol was designed as part of a project at the University of Hawaii. It provided data transmission between computers on several of the Hawaiian Islands using packet radio networks. Aloha is a multiple access protocol at the data link layer and proposes how multiple terminals can access the medium without interference or collision. There are two different versions of Aloha:
"Pure Aloha is an un-slotted, decentralized, and simple-to-implement protocol. In pure Aloha, the stations simply transmit frames whenever they want data to send. It does not check whether the channel is busy or not before transmitting. In the event that two or more stations transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs and frames are destroyed. Whenever any station transmits a frame, it expects acknowledgment from the receiver. If it is not received within a specified time, the station assumes that the frame or acknowledgment has been destroyed. Then, the station waits for a random amount of time and sends the frame again. This randomness helps in avoiding more collisions. This scheme works well in small networks where the load is not much. But in largely loaded networks, this scheme fails poorly. This led to the development of Slotted Aloha. To assure pure aloha: Its throughput and rate of transmission of the frame are to be predicted. For that, let’s make some assumptions:"
"This is quite similar to Pure Aloha, differing only in the way transmissions take place. Instead of transmitting right at the demand time, the sender waits for some time. In slotted ALOHA, the time of the shared channel is divided into discrete intervals called Slots. The stations are eligible to send a frame only at the beginning of the slot and only one frame per slot is sent. If any station is not able to place the frame onto the channel at the beginning of the slot, it has to wait until the beginning of the next time slot. There is still a possibility of collision if two stations try to send at the beginning of the same time slot. But still, the number of collisions that can possibly take place is reduced by a large margin and the performance becomes much well compared to Pure Aloha."
"Collision is possible only in the current slot. Therefore, Vulnerable Time is Tt. The efficiency of Slotted Aloha"
"In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the Ethernet is located in the lower layers and facilitates the operation of the physical and data link layers. The OSI model consists of seven layers, which are as follows."
"The topmost layer, known as the application layer, is what enables users to download and access data from email clients or web browsers. With the aid of the application, users enter their queries, and the request is then sent to the following layer, which is known as a “packet.” The packet contains data about the sender and the destination web address. The packet is transmitted from the application layer until it reaches the bottom layer, also known as the Ethernet frame."
"Frames are the units of digital transmission, particularly in computer networks and telecommunications. Frames are comparable to the packets of energy called photons in the case of light energy. Frame is continuously used in Time Division Multiplexing process."
"Framing is a point-to-point connection between two computers or devices consisting of a wire in which data is transmitted as a stream of bits. However, these bits must be framed into discernible blocks of information. Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, and other data link layer technologies have their own frame structures. Frames have headers that contain information such as error-checking codes."
"At the data link layer, it extracts the message from the sender and provides it to the receiver by providing the sender’s and receiver’s addresses. The advantage of using frames is that data is broken up into recoverable chunks that can easily be checked for corruption."
The process of dividing the data into frames and reassembling it is transparent to the user and is handled by the data link layer.
"Framing is an important aspect of data link layer protocol design because it allows the transmission of data to be organized and controlled, ensuring that the data is delivered accurately and efficiently.Problems in Framing"
"There are two types of framing: 1. Fixed-size: The frame is of fixed size and there is no need to provide boundaries to the frame, the length of the frame itself acts as a delimiter."
"2. Variable size: In this, there is a need to define the end of the frame as well as the beginning of the next frame to distinguish. This can be done in two ways:"
"2. Bit Stuffing: Let ED = 01111 and if data = 01111 –> Sender stuffs a bit to break the pattern i.e. here appends a 0 in data = 011101. –> Receiver receives the frame. –> If data contains 011101, receiver removes the 0 and reads the data."
"Variable frame length: The length of frames can vary depending on the data being transmitted, which can lead to inefficiencies in transmission. To address this issue, protocols such as HDLC and PPP use a flag sequence to mark the start and end of each frame."
"Bit stuffing: Bit stuffing is a technique used to prevent data from being interpreted as control characters by inserting extra bits into the data stream. However, bit stuffing can lead to issues with synchronization and increase the overhead of the transmission."
"Synchronization: Synchronization is critical for ensuring that data frames are transmitted and received correctly. However, synchronization can be challenging, particularly in high-speed networks where frames are transmitted rapidly."
"Error detection: Data Link Layer protocols use various techniques to detect errors in the transmitted data, such as checksums and CRCs. However, these techniques are not foolproof and can miss some types of errors."
"Efficiency: Efficient use of available bandwidth is critical for ensuring that data is transmitted quickly and reliably. However, the overhead associated with framing and error detection can reduce the overall efficiency of the transmission."
"Prerequisite – Basics of CSMA/ CD, Collision Detection in CSMA/CD"
"Back-off algorithm is a collision resolution mechanism which is used in random access MAC protocols (CSMA/CD). This algorithm is generally used in Ethernet to schedule re-transmissions after collisions. If a collision takes place between 2 stations, they may restart transmission as soon as they can after the collision. This will always lead to another collision and form an infinite loop of collisions leading to a deadlock. To prevent such scenario back-off algorithm is used. Let us consider a scenario of 2 stations A and B transmitting some data:"
"After a collision, time is divided into discrete slots (Tslot) whose length is equal to 2t, where t is the maximum propagation delay in the network. The stations involved in the collision randomly pick an integer from the set K i.e {0, 1}. This set is called the contention window. If the sources collide again because they picked the same integer, the contention window size is doubled and it becomes {0, 1, 2, 3}. Now the sources involved in the second collision randomly pick an integer from the set {0, 1, 2, 3} and wait for that number of time slots before trying again. Before they try to transmit, they listen to the channel and transmit only if the channel is idle. This causes the source which picked the smallest integer in the contention window to succeed in transmitting its frame. So, the Back-off algorithm defines a waiting time for the stations involved in collision, i.e. for how much time the station should wait to re-transmit."
"Example – Case-1 : Suppose 2 stations A and B start transmitting data (Packet 1) at the same time then, collision occurs. So, the collision number n for both their data (Packet 1) = 1. Now, both the station randomly pick an integer from the set K i.e. {0, 1}."
"Case-2: Assume that A wins in Case 1 and transmitted its data(Packet 1). Now, as soon as B transmits its packet 1, A transmits its packet 2. Hence, collision occurs. Now collision no. n becomes 1 for packet 2 of A and becomes 2 for packet 1 of B. For packet 2 of A, K = {0, 1} For packet 1 of B, K = {0, 1, 2, 3}"
"So, the probability of collision decreases as compared to Case 1."
"When a collision occurs, the transmitting device waits for a random amount of time before retransmitting the packet. The random delay helps to prevent multiple devices from retransmitting their packets simultaneously and causing another collision."
"The random delay time is determined using an exponential back-off algorithm. The delay time starts at a minimum value and doubles after each collision, up to a maximum value. The maximum delay time is usually set to 1024 slot times, where a slot time is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of the network segment to the other."
"The back-off algorithm is implemented in hardware on the network interface card (NIC) of each device. When a collision is detected, the NIC generates a random number between 0 and 2^n-1, where n is the number of collisions that have occurred. The NIC then multiplies the random number by the slot time to determine the delay time before retransmitting."
"If the maximum number of retransmissions is reached without successful transmission, the device gives up and reports a transmission error."
"Internetworking is combined of 2 words, inter and networking which implies an association between totally different nodes or segments. This connection area unit is established through intercessor devices akin to routers or gateway. The first term for associate degree internetwork was catenet. This interconnection is often among or between public, private, commercial, industrial, or governmental networks. Thus, associate degree internetwork could be an assortment of individual networks, connected by intermediate networking devices, that function as one giant network. Internetworking refers to the trade, products, and procedures that meet the challenge of making and administering internet works. To enable communication, every individual network node or phase is designed with a similar protocol or communication logic, that is Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP). Once a network communicates with another network having constant communication procedures, it’s called Internetworking. Internetworking was designed to resolve the matter of delivering a packet of information through many links. There is a minute difference between extending the network and Internetworking. Merely exploitation of either a switch or a hub to attach 2 local area networks is an extension of LAN whereas connecting them via the router is an associate degree example of Internetworking. Internetworking is enforced in Layer three (Network Layer) of the OSI-ISO model. The foremost notable example of internetworking is the Internet. There is chiefly 3 units of Internetworking:"
"Intranets and extranets might or might not have connections to the net. If there is a connection to the net, the computer network or extranet area unit is usually shielded from being accessed from the net if it is not authorized. The net isn’t thought-about to be a section of the computer network or extranet, though it should function as a portal for access to parts of the associate degree extranet."
"Internetworking has evolved as an answer to a few key problems: isolated LANs, duplication of resources, and an absence of network management. Isolated LANs created transmission problems between totally different offices or departments. Duplication of resources meant that constant hardware and code had to be provided to every workplace or department, as did a separate support employee. This lack of network management meant that no centralized methodology of managing and troubleshooting networks existed. One more form of the interconnection of networks usually happens among enterprises at the Link Layer of the networking model, i.e. at the hardware-centric layer below the amount of the TCP/IP logical interfaces. Such interconnection is accomplished through network bridges and network switches. This can be typically incorrectly termed internetworking, however, the ensuing system is just a bigger, single subnetwork, and no internetworking protocol, akin to web Protocol, is needed to traverse these devices. However, one electronic network is also reborn into associate degree internetwork by dividing the network into phases and logically dividing the segment traffic with routers. The Internet Protocol is meant to supply an associate degree unreliable packet service across the network. The design avoids intermediate network components maintaining any state of the network. Instead, this task is allotted to the endpoints of every communication session. To transfer information correctly, applications should utilize associate degree applicable Transport Layer protocol, akin to Transmission management Protocol (TCP), that provides a reliable stream. Some applications use a less complicated, connection-less transport protocol, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for tasks that don’t need reliable delivery of information or that need period of time service, akin to video streaming or voice chat."
"Internetwork addresses establish devices severally or as members of a bunch. Addressing schemes differ based on the protocol family and therefore the OSI layer. Three kinds of internetwork addresses area units are ordinarily used: data-link layer addresses, Media Access control (MAC) addresses, and network-layer addresses."
"Implementing useful internetwork isn’t at any certainty. There are several challenging fields, particularly in the areas of dependableness, connectivity, network management, and adaptability, and each and every space is essential in establishing associate degree economical and effective internetwork. A few of them are:-"
"Increased connectivity: Internetworking enables devices on different networks to communicate with each other, which increases connectivity and enables new applications and services."
"Resource sharing: Internetworking allows devices to share resources across networks, such as printers, servers, and storage devices. This can reduce costs and improve efficiency by allowing multiple devices to share resources."
Improved scalability: Internetworking allows networks to be expanded and scaled as needed to accommodate growing numbers of devices and users.
"Improved collaboration: Internetworking enables teams and individuals to collaborate and work together more effectively, regardless of their physical location."
"Access to remote resources: Internetworking allows users to access resources and services that are physically located on remote networks, improving accessibility and flexibility."
"Security risks: Internetworking can create security vulnerabilities and increase the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Connecting multiple networks together increases the number of entry points for attackers, making it more difficult to secure the entire system."
Complexity: Internetworking can be complex and requires specialized knowledge and expertise to set up and maintain. This can increase costs and create additional maintenance overhead.
"Performance issues: Internetworking can lead to performance issues, particularly if networks are not properly optimized and configured. This can result in slow response times and poor network performance."
"Compatibility issues: Internetworking can lead to compatibility issues, particularly if different networks are using different protocols or technologies. This can make it difficult to integrate different systems and may require additional resources to resolve."
"Management overhead: Internetworking can create additional management overhead, particularly if multiple networks are involved. This can increase costs and require additional resources to manage effectively.References: Internetworking – Wiki Introduction to Internetworking"
The computer network is defined as a set of interconnected autonomous systems that facilitate distributed processing of information. It results in better performance with a high speed of processing. Computer Networks can be defined as collections of two or more computer networks that are linked together.
Some of the applications of Computer Networking are discussed below:
Some of the main advantages of Computer Networking are discussed below:
Some of the main disadvantages of Computer Networking are discussed below:
"There are 12 types of Computer Networks, which are listed below:"
"For more, you can refer to Types of Computer Networking."
The cast term here signifies some data(stream of packets) is being transmitted to the recipient(s) from the client(s) side over the communication channel that helps them to communicate. Let’s see some of the “cast” concepts that are prevailing in the computer networks field.
"This type of information transfer is useful when there is a participation of a single sender and a single recipient. So, in short, you can term it a one-to-one transmission. For example, if a device having IP address 10.1.2.0 in a network wants to send the traffic stream(data packets) to the device with IP address 20.12.4.2 in the other network, then unicast comes into the picture. This is the most common form of data transfer over networks."
Broadcasting transfer (one-to-all) techniques can be classified into two types:
"Limited Broadcasting: Suppose you have to send a stream of packets to all the devices over the network that your reside, this broadcasting comes in handy. For this to achieve, it will append 255.255.255.255 (all the 32 bits of IP address set to 1) called Limited Broadcast Address in the destination address of the datagram (packet) header which is reserved for information transfer to all the recipients from a single client (sender) over the network."
"Direct Broadcasting: This is useful when a device in one network wants to transfer packet stream to all the devices over the other network. This is achieved by translating all the Host ID part bits of the destination address to 1, referred to as Direct Broadcast Address in the datagram header for information transfer."
This mode is mainly utilized by television networks for video and audio distribution. One important protocol of this class in Computer Networks is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used for resolving an IP address into a physical address which is necessary for underlying communication.
"In multicasting, one/more senders and one/more recipients participate in data transfer traffic. In this method traffic recline between the boundaries of unicast (one-to-one) and broadcast (one-to-all). Multicast lets servers direct single copies of data streams that are then simulated and routed to hosts that request it. IP multicast requires the support of some other protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), Multicast routing for its work. Also in Classful IP addressing Class D is reserved for multicast groups. Questions Corner:Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge. It is highly recommended that you practice them."
"In controlled access, the stations seek information from one another to find which station has the right to send. It allows only one node to send at a time, to avoid the collision of messages on a shared medium. The three controlled-access methods are:"
"The following figure shows a situation with five stations and a five-slot reservation frame. In the first interval, only stations 1, 3, and 4 have made reservations. In the second interval, only station 1 has made a reservation."
"Efficiency Let Tpoll be the time for polling and Tt be the time required for transmission of data. Then,"
Performance of token ring can be concluded by 2 parameters:-
"Normally, Routers are used to divide the broadcast domain and switches (at layer 2) Operate in a single broadcast domain but Switches can also divide the broadcast domain by using the concept of VLAN (Virtual LAN). VLAN is the logical grouping of devices in the same or different broadcast domains. By default, all the switch ports are in VLAN 1. As the single broadcast domain is divided into multiple broadcast domains, Routers or layer 3 switches are used for intercommunication between the different VLANs.The process of intercommunication of the different Vlans is known as Inter Vlan Routing (IVR). Suppose we have made 2 logical groups of devices (VLAN) named sales and finance. If a device in the sales department wants to communicate with a device in the finance department, inter-VLAN routing has to be performed. These can be performed by either router or layer 3 switches. Switch Virtual Interface (SVI): SVI is a logical interface on a multilayer switch that provides layer 3 processing for packets to all switch ports associated with that VLAN. A single SVI can be created for a VLAN. SVI on the layer 3 switch provides both management and routing services while SVI on layer 2 switch provides only management services like creating VLANs or telnet/SSH services. Process of Inter Vlan Routing by Layer 3 Switch: The SVI created for the respective VLAN acts as a default gateway for that VLAN just like the sub-interface of the router (in the process of Router On a stick). If the packet is to be delivered to different VLANs i.e inter VLAN Routing is to be performed on the layer 3 switch then first the packet is delivered to the layer 3 switch and then to the destination just like in the process of the router on a stick. Configuration:"
"Here is a topology in which we have a layer 3 switch connected to host devices namely PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4. The hosts PC1, PC2 will be in Vlan 10, and PC3, PC4 will be in Vlan 20. Giving IP addresses to All hosts. PC1-192.168.1.10/24, PC2-192.168.1.20/24, PC3 – 192.168.2.10/24, PC4-192.168.2.20/24."
"Now creating VLANs on layer 3 switches namely VLAN 2 on the switch ports fa0/1, 2 and fa0/3, 4 for VLAN 3."
Now creating SVI for VLAN 2 giving it IP address 192.168.1.1/24 and SVI for VLAN 3 giving IP address 192.168.2.1/24
"Now if we will try to ping PC1 to PC4. The packet is first delivered to switch then to the destination. As the destination is present in other networks, the packet will be first delivered to the switch which has an SVI for both VLANs (acts as gateway)."
"In the Router on the stick method, both switch and router are needed but while using layer 3 switches, a single switch will perform inter-VLAN routing as well as the layer 2 functions (Vlan), therefore this method is cost-effective and also less configuration is needed."
"1.Network Division:  Inter VLAN directing permits network chairmen to partition the organization into various intelligent portions or VLANs. Each VLAN can have its own IP subnet and security approaches, which further develops network execution and security."
"2.Virtualization: Inter VLAN directing is a fundamental part of organization virtualization, which empowers different virtual organizations to coincide on a similar actual organization foundation. This empowers productive utilization of assets and takes into consideration better organization adaptability."
"3.Load Adjusting: Inter VLAN directing can be utilized to stack balance traffic between VLANs. By circulating traffic across different VLANs, network heads can forestall bottlenecks and further develop network execution."
"4.Access Control: Inter VLAN directing can be utilized to apply access control strategies to traffic between VLANs. For instance, network managers can utilize access control records (leg tendons) to control traffic among VLANs and implement security strategies."
"5.Voice over IP (VoIP): Inter VLAN directing is basic for VoIP executions, which require various VLANs to help various sorts of traffic. VoIP traffic should be isolated from different sorts of traffic to guarantee nature of administration (QoS), and between VLAN steering empowers this division."
The Data Link Layer is responsible for transmission of data between two nodes. Its main functions are-
"Data Link control – The data link control is responsible for reliable transmission of message over transmission channel by using techniques like framing, error control and flow control. For Data link control refer to – Stop and Wait ARQ Multiple Access Control – If there is a dedicated link between the sender and the receiver then data link control layer is sufficient, however if there is no dedicated link present then multiple stations can access the channel simultaneously. Hence multiple access protocols are required to decrease collision and avoid crosstalk. For example, in a classroom full of students, when a teacher asks a question and all the students (or stations) start answering simultaneously (send data at same time) then a lot of chaos is created( data overlap or data lost) then it is the job of the teacher (multiple access protocols) to manage the students and make them answer one at a time. Thus, protocols are required for sharing data on non dedicated channels. Multiple access protocols can be subdivided further as –"
"1. Random Access Protocol: In this, all stations have same superiority that is no station has more priority than another station. Any station can send data depending on medium’s state( idle or busy). It has two features:"
"The Random access protocols are further subdivided as: (a) ALOHA – It was designed for wireless LAN but is also applicable for shared medium. In this, multiple stations can transmit data at the same time and can hence lead to collision and data being garbled."
"For more information on ALOHA refer – LAN Technologies (b) CSMA – Carrier Sense Multiple Access ensures fewer collisions as the station is required to first sense the medium (for idle or busy) before transmitting data. If it is idle then it sends data, otherwise it waits till the channel becomes idle. However there is still chance of collision in CSMA due to propagation delay. For example, if station A wants to send data, it will first sense the medium.If it finds the channel idle, it will start sending data. However, by the time the first bit of data is transmitted (delayed due to propagation delay) from station A, if station B requests to send data and senses the medium it will also find it idle and will also send data. This will result in collision of data from station A and B. CSMA access modes-"
"(c) CSMA/CD – Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection. Stations can terminate transmission of data if collision is detected. For more details refer – Efficiency of CSMA/CD (d) CSMA/CA – Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance. The process of collisions detection involves sender receiving acknowledgement signals. If there is just one signal(its own) then the data is successfully sent but if there are two signals(its own and the one with which it has collided) then it means a collision has occurred. To distinguish between these two cases, collision must have a lot of impact on received signal. However it is not so in wired networks, so CSMA/CA is used in this case. CSMA/CA avoids collision by:"
"2. Controlled Access: In this, the data is sent by that station which is approved by all other stations. For further details refer – Controlled Access Protocols 3. Channelization: In this, the available bandwidth of the link is shared in time, frequency and code to multiple stations to access channel simultaneously."
"Contention-based access: Multiple access protocols are typically contention-based, meaning that multiple devices compete for access to the communication channel. This can lead to collisions if two or more devices transmit at the same time, which can result in data loss and decreased network performance."
"Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA): CSMA is a widely used multiple access protocol in which devices listen for carrier signals on the communication channel before transmitting. If a carrier signal is detected, the device waits for a random amount of time before attempting to transmit to reduce the likelihood of collisions."
"Collision Detection (CD): CD is a feature of some multiple access protocols that allows devices to detect when a collision has occurred and take appropriate action, such as backing off and retrying the transmission."
Collision Avoidance (CA): CA is a feature of some multiple access protocols that attempts to avoid collisions by assigning time slots to devices for transmission.
"Token passing: Token passing is a multiple access protocol in which devices pass a special token between each other to gain access to the communication channel. Devices can only transmit data when they hold the token, which ensures that only one device can transmit at a time."
"Bandwidth utilization: Multiple access protocols can affect the overall bandwidth utilization of a network. For example, contention-based protocols may result in lower bandwidth utilization due to collisions, while token passing protocols may result in higher bandwidth utilization due to the controlled access to the communication channel."
"Basic frame format which is required for all MAC implementation is defined in IEEE 802.3 standard. Though several optional formats are being used to extend the protocol’s basic capability. Ethernet frame starts with Preamble and SFD, both work at the physical layer. Ethernet header contains both the Source and Destination MAC address, after which the payload of the frame is present. The last field is CRC which is used to detect the error. Now, let’s study each field of basic frame format."
"Standard IEEE 802.3 basic frame format is discussed above in detail. Now let’s see the extended Ethernet frame header, using which we can get a Payload even larger than 1500 Bytes."

"Limited frame size: The Ethernet frame format has a maximum frame size of 1500 bytes, which can limit the amount of data that can be transmitted in a single frame and can result in increased overhead due to fragmentation and reassembly of larger packets."
"Broadcast storms: Ethernet networks use broadcast transmissions to send frames to all devices on the network, which can lead to broadcast storms if too many devices send broadcast frames simultaneously, resulting in network congestion and performance issues."
"Security vulnerabilities: The Ethernet frame format does not include built-in security features, making Ethernet networks vulnerable to security threats such as eavesdropping and spoofing."
"Limited speed: Ethernet networks have a limited maximum speed, which may not be sufficient for high-speed applications or large-scale networks."

"We’ve been studying a lot about the Wired Network. Ethernet is the most common example. Wired networks differ from wireless which uses radio waves rather than transmitting electrical signals over the cables. Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the internet via WLAN network and a wireless access point abbreviated as AP. Every WLAN has an access point which is responsible for receiving and transmitting data from/to users. IEEE has defined certain specifications for wireless LAN, called IEEE 802.11 which covers physical and data link layers. Access Point(AP) is a wireless LAN base station that can connect one or many wireless devices simultaneously to internet.   The architecture of this standard has 2 kinds of services: 1. BSS (Basic Service Set) 2. ESS (Extended Service Set)   BSS is the basic building block of WLAN. It is made of wireless mobile stations and an optional central base station called Access Point. Stations can form a network without an AP and can agree to be a part of a BSS. A BSS without an AP cannot send data to other BSSs and defines a standalone network. It is called Ad-hoc network or Independent BSS(IBSS).i.e A BSS without AP is an ad-hoc network. A BSS with AP is infrastructure network. The figure below depicts an IBSS, BSS with the green coloured box depicting an AP.  ESS is made up of 2 or more BSSs with APs. BSSs are connected to the distribution system via their APs. The distribution system can be any IEEE LAN such as Ethernet.   ESS has 2 kinds of stations: 1. Mobile – stations inside the BSS 2. Stationary – AP stations that are part of wired LAN.  The topmost green box represents the distribution system and the other 2 green boxes represent the APs of 2 BSSs."

"Internet Of Everything (IoE) has been one of the trending topics lately, and it’s here, IoE is the upcoming most innovative and Ubiquitous technology advancement which is going to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before. Turning information into action creates new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunities for businesses, individuals, and countries. Technically, IoE refers to billions of devices and consumer products connected to the internet in an intelligent networked environment with expanded digital features. It is basically a philosophy in which our technology future is composed of different types of appliances, devices, and things connected to the global internet. As of now, the internet connection is only restricted to phone/Tablets, PCs, and a handful of other devices but the idea behind IoE is that in the future, machines will become more intelligent and cognitive by having more access to data and expanded network opportunities. In simpler terms, IoE is the intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things that will be transforming our world in such a way that there will be billions of connected devices having sensors to detect, measure and access their status all of which will be connected over a public or private network built over standard protocols like TCP/IP. So how is the; Internet of Everything any different from the Internet of Things?"
"Well, the difference is the intelligent connection. IoT is mostly about physical devices and objects communicating with each other, but IoE brings with it network intelligence to bind all these concepts together into a cohesive system. IoT has been limited to only machines thus achieving Machine Machine Communication but IoE brings together people, processes, data, and things and adds them into the network therefore not just phones/tablets and PCs but people. Health Fitness bands, Coffee pots, and Marine Container’s all become a Node in an intelligent network communicating with each other. The more expansive IoE concepts include, besides M2M communication, M2P, and technology-assisted P2P communication. The IoE Economy will profoundly affect four major Aspects of our lives:"
"As of 1984, only 1000 devices were connected to the internet which increased to about 1 million in 1992 and shot across 10 Billion in 2010, and as Cisco predicts there will be around 50 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020. These devices will be fetching data from their environment internally or externally and sending it back to the server for analyzing and making much more intelligent decisions."
"Here the data is more about insightful information and action plan than just a random chunk. Figuring out a way to decipher the right flow of information is the key to making the best use of Big Data and as the types of data and sources increase, in order to draw useful insight there will be a need to classify information and analyze it."
"General Electrics predicts that IoE can add 15 trillion dollars to the Global Domestic Product while Cisco estimates 19 trillion in savings and profits for companies that can leverage IoE. But as the number of devices connected to the internet increase and therefore collect more data, privacy is put at risk which increases security concerns, but as these devices grow more intelligent, hopes are that the device and network will grow knowledgeable enough to detect, stop and prevent any harmful threats. IoE is here and is inevitable, we should embrace ourselves to adapt our lives to the changes that it brings with it."

In circuit switching network resources (bandwidth) are divided into pieces and bit delay is constant during a connection. The dedicated path/circuit established between sender and receiver provides a guaranteed data rate. Data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established.
Telephone system network is one of the example of Circuit switching. TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) and FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) are two methods of multiplexing multiple signals into a single carrier.
"Inefficient use of resources: Circuit switching requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path between two nodes, which means that the resources along that path, such as bandwidth and switch ports, are reserved for the duration of the communication. This can result in inefficient use of resources, as the resources may remain unused during periods of low or no communication."
"Limited scalability: Circuit switching is not well-suited for large-scale networks with many nodes, as it requires a dedicated communication path between each pair of nodes. This can result in a high degree of complexity and difficulty in managing the network."
"Vulnerability to failures: Circuit switching relies on a dedicated communication path, which can make the network vulnerable to failures, such as cable cuts or switch failures. In the event of a failure, the communication path must be re-established, which can result in delays or loss of data."
"Delay and latency: Circuit switching requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path, which can result in delay and latency in establishing the path and transmitting data. This can impact the real-time performance of applications, such as voice and video."
"High cost: Circuit switching requires the reservation of resources, which can result in a high cost, particularly in large-scale networks. This can make circuit switching less practical for some applications."
"Lack of flexibility: Circuit switching is not flexible as it only allows one type of communication at a time, such as voice or data. This can limit the ability of users to perform multiple tasks simultaneously."
"Limited mobility: Circuit switching is not well-suited for mobile devices or nodes that move frequently, as it requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path. This can result in communication disruptions or dropped calls."
Limited capacity: Circuit switching can have limited capacity as it requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path between two nodes. This can limit the number of simultaneous communications that can occur.
High setup time: Circuit switching requires a significant setup time to establish the dedicated communication path between two nodes. This can result in delays in initiating communication.
"No prioritization: Circuit switching does not provide any mechanism for prioritizing certain types of traffic over others. This can result in delays or poor performance for time-critical applications, such as voice or video."
Advantages of Circuit Switching: It has the following advantages :
Disadvantages of Circuit Switching: It has the following disadvantages :
"Question on Circuit switching – These questions will help you understand circuit switching  Example 1 : How long it takes to send a file of ‘x bits’ from host A to host B over a circuit switched network that uses TDM with ‘h slots’ and have a bit rate of ‘R Mbps’, circuit establish time is k seconds.Find total time? Explanation : Transmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate / no. of slots = R/h bps Transmission time = size of file/ transmission rate = x / (R/h) = (x*h)/R Total time = transmission time + circuit setup time = (x*h)/R secs + k secs  Example 2 : If a link transmits F frames/sec and each slot has B bits then find the transmission rate? Explanation : Since it is not mention how many slots in each frame we take one frame has one slot. The transmission rate is the amount of data sent in 1 second. Transmission rate = F * B bits/sec"

"Prerequisite – Virtual LAN (VLAN) Virtual LAN (VLAN) is used to break a broadcast domain into smaller domain at layer 2. Only (all) hosts belonging to same VLAN are able to communicate with each other while communicating with other VLAN hosts, Inter Vlan routing is done. But in same VLAN, if we want some hosts should not be able to communicate with other hosts (in the same VLAN) at layer 2 level then VLAN access-list or concept of private VLAN is used. Private VLAN – Private VLAN are used to break the layer 2 broadcast domain into small subdomains. A subdomain consists of one primary VLAN and one or more secondary VLAN."
Note – VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) should be operating in mode transparent or off in order to configure private VLANs. Configuration –
"Here is a topology in which Router1 (IP address- 192.168.1.1/24), PC1(IP address- 192.168.1.10/24 ), PC2(IP address- 192.168.1.20/24 ), PC3 (IP address- 192.168.1.30/24) and switch are connected to each other as shown in the figure. In this task, we will assign VLAN 10 to fa0/1, fa0/2, and VLAN 20 to fa0/3 and fa0/0 as VLAN 100. Then, we will make VLAN 10 as community VLAN, VLAN 20 as isolated VLAN and VLAN 100 as primary VLAN. Configuring Private VLAN on switch:"
"Here, we have created VLAN 10 and configured it as community VLAN. Now, configuring isolated VLAN."
"Now, creating vlan 100 and configuring it as primary VLAN and associating secondary vlan 10, 20 to it."
"Now, configuring ports as private-vlan host port and associating them with primary and secondary VLAN. First configuring fa0/1 and fa0/2 and associating vlan 10 (secondary VLAN) with its primary VLAN (vlan 100)."
"Now, configuring fa0/3 and associating vlan 20 (secondary VLAN) with its primary VLAN (vlan 100)."
"Now, at last we will configure interface fa0/0 as promiscuous port and associate the port with primary vlan (vlan 100) and secondary VLAN (vlan 10, 20)."
We can verify the ports associated with secondary VLANs by command.
If you want to verify the primary VLAN and secondary VLAN (Isolated or Community) then use the command.
"1.Isolation of gadgets: Private VLANs can be utilized to separate gadgets inside a VLAN from one another. For instance, in a common facilitating climate, you can utilize a Private VLAN to seclude the virtual servers from one another, keeping them from conveying straightforwardly."
"2.Security: Private VLANs can be utilized to upgrade security by keeping specific gadgets from speaking with different gadgets inside a similar VLAN. For instance, you can utilize a Private VLAN to disengage an organization portion containing delicate data from the remainder of the organization."
"3.Simplified organization the executives: Private VLANs can be utilized to work on network the board by decreasing the quantity of VLANs required. Rather than making separate VLANs for each gathering of gadgets, you can utilize a solitary VLAN with various Private VLANs."
"4.Compliance: Private VLANs can assist with meeting consistence prerequisites by secluding traffic containing touchy data or frameworks. For instance, Installment Card Industry (PCI) consistence expects that Visa information be detached from other traffic, which can be accomplished utilizing Private VLANs."
Bridge is a local internetworking device that is used to connect two or more network segments together. A bridge operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses the MAC addresses of devices to make forwarding decisions.
"Bridges were first introduced in the 1980s as a way to connect Ethernet segments together and extend the reach of a network. They were initially used to overcome the distance limitations of Ethernet networks, allowing multiple segments to be connected together to form a larger network."
Bridges work by examining the MAC addresses of devices on each network segment and forwarding packets only to the segment where the destination device is located. This helps to reduce network congestion and improve performance by limiting unnecessary traffic.
"Bridges can also be used to create separate collision domains, which helps to improve network performance by reducing collisions on the network. Collisions occur when two devices transmit data at the same time, causing a data collision that requires the data to be re-transmitted."
"Bridges can be used to connect different types of network segments, including Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI. They can also be used to connect wireless networks to wired networks, providing a way to extend the range and coverage of a wireless network."
"Overall, bridges are an important networking device that provides a way to connect multiple network segments together, improving network performance and extending the reach of a network."
"Local Internetworking is one which is within the same organization i.e. same building or same campus, then for the networking, we may not require the full power of the router. We can do it with a data link layer device called a bridge. Bridges: Bridges are a data link layer device and can connect to different networks as well as connect different networks of different types. Bridges from 802.x to 802.y where x & y may both be ethernet or one can be ethernet and other may be a token ring, etc. It locally connects small LANs, whereas if LANs are big then bridges can no longer handle them. Bridge follows a protocol in IEEE format execute 802.1 which is a spanning tree of bridges."
"In the above figure, there are four LANs that are connected by two bridges. Bridge 1 has two ports, one connecting to LAN 1 other connecting to LAN 2, Bridge 2 has three connecting to LAN 2, LAN 3, and LAN 4. So, A can communicate with H through two bridges."
"What if the host is moved to another segment or a new host is connected to a segment? If a new host is connected then the learning process of bridges is going to be a continuous process. Suppose if we move from LAN 1 to LAN 2 some machine, i.e. MAC address moves from LAN 1 to LAN 2, which means table entries should leave after some time so that the data remains fresh and relevant. Bridges Spanning Tree: For increased reliability, it is desirable to have redundant, alternative paths from source to destination, and with multiple paths, cycles result- bridges may multiply and forward frame forever without the frames being dropped. The solution is to organize bridges in a spanning tree by disabling a subset of interfaces."
"Improved Network Performance: Bridges can improve network performance by reducing network congestion and improving data transmission speeds, resulting in faster network speeds and reduced latency."
"Better Network Security: Bridges can help to improve network security by creating logical isolation between different network segments, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of network attacks."
"Flexible Network Design: Bridges allow for flexible network design by enabling the connection of different network technologies and types, including Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, among others."
"Easy to Install and Configure: Bridges are relatively easy to install and configure, requiring minimal configuration and maintenance, making them an ideal solution for small to medium-sized networks."
"Limited Scalability: Bridges may not be scalable in larger networks, as the number of devices and network segments increases, which can lead to network congestion and performance degradation."
"Single Point of Failure: Bridges can be a single point of failure in the network, and if they fail, it can cause network downtime until the bridge is replaced."
"Limited Functionality: Bridges have limited functionality compared to other network devices, such as routers and switches, and may not be suitable for all network configurations and requirements."
"Higher Cost: Bridges can be more expensive compared to other network devices, such as hubs, which can make them less cost-effective for smaller networks."
"Prerequisites – Stop & Wait, Go Back N, Selective Repeat"
Before starting with the questions a quick recap for all the protocols. Stop and wait –
"A network is two or more devices connected through a link. A link is a communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another. Devices can be a computer, printer, or any other device that is capable to send and receive data. For visualization purposes, imagine any link as a line drawn between two points."
"For communication to occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time. There are two possible types of connections:"
Example: Point-to-Point connection between the remote control and Television for changing the channels.
"Choosing the right line configuration depends on the specific needs of the network, including factors such as the size of the network, the type of data being transmitted, the level of reliability required, and the available resources. Different line configurations can offer various advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal configuration will depend on the specific use case."
"Spatial Sharing: If several devices can share the link simultaneously, it’s called Spatially shared line configuration."
"Temporal (Time) Sharing: If users must take turns using the link, then it’s called Temporally shared or Time Shared Line configuration."
"Prerequisite – Network Devices, Switch functions at layer 2, Difference between layer-2 and layer-3 switches"
Switches are the connectivity points of an Ethernet network. These are small devices that can receive data from multiple input ports and send it to the specific output port that takes data to its intended destination in the network. There are different types of switches in a network. These are:
Unmanaged switches: These are the switches that are mostly used in home networks and small businesses as they plug in and instantly start doing their job and such switches do not need to be watched or configured. These require only small cable connections. It allows devices on a network to connect with each other such as a computer to a computer or a computer to a printer in one location. They are the least expensive switches among all categories.
"Managed switches: These types of switches have many features like the highest levels of security, precision control, and full management of the network. These are used in organizations containing a large network and can be customized to enhance the functionality of a certain network. These are the most costly option but their scalability makes them an ideal option for a network that is growing. They are achieved by setting a simple network management protocol(SNMP)."
(I) Smart switches: These switches offer basic management features with the ability to create some levels of security but have a simpler management interface than the other managed switches. Thus they are often called partially managed switches. These are mostly used in fast and constant LANs which support gigabit data transfer and allocations. It can accept the configuration of VLANs (Virtual LAN).
"(II) Enterprise-managed switches: They have features like the ability to fix, copy, transform and display different network configurations, along with a web interface SNMP agent and command-line interface. These are also known as fully managed switches and are more expensive than smart switches as they have more features that can be enhanced. These are used in organizations that contain a large number of ports, switches, and nodes."
"There are several types of switches used in computer networking, including:"
"The Stop and Wait ARQ offers error and flow control but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgment even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection), you can’t use this full speed due to limitations of stop and wait."
Sliding Window protocol handles this efficiency issue by sending more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number. The idea is the same as pipelining in architecture.
Transmission Delay (Tt) – Time to transmit the packet from the host to the outgoing link. If B is the Bandwidth of the link and D is the Data Size to transmit
Propagation Delay (Tp) – It is the time taken by the first bit transferred by the host onto the outgoing link to reach the destination. It depends on the distance d and the wave propagation speed s (depends on the characteristics of the medium).
"Efficiency – It is defined as the ratio of total useful time to the total cycle time of a packet. For stop and wait protocol,"
"Since acknowledgements are very less in size, their transmission delay can be neglected."
Effective Bandwidth(EB) or Throughput – Number of bits sent per second.
"Capacity of link – If a channel is Full Duplex, then bits can be transferred in both the directions and without any collisions. Number of bits a channel/Link can hold at maximum is its capacity."
"In Stop and Wait protocol, only 1 packet is transmitted onto the link and then sender waits for acknowledgement from the receiver. The problem in this setup is that efficiency is very less as we are not filling the channel with more packets after 1st packet has been put onto the link. Within the total cycle time of Tt + 2*Tp units, we will now calculate the maximum number of packets that sender can transmit on the link before getting an acknowledgement."
"Maximum packets That can be Transmitted in total cycle time = 1+2*a Let me explain now with the help of an example. Consider Tt = 1ms, Tp = 1.5ms. In the picture given below, after sender has transmitted packet 0, it will immediately transmit packets 1, 2, 3. Acknowledgement for 0 will arrive after 2*1.5 = 3ms. In Stop and Wait, in time 1 + 2*1.5 = 4ms, we were transferring one packet only. Here we keep a window of packets that we have transmitted but not yet acknowledged.  After we have received the Ack for packet 0, window slides and the next packet can be assigned sequence number 0. We reuse the sequence numbers which we have acknowledged so that header size can be kept minimum as shown in the diagram given below."
"All the packets in the current window will be given a sequence number. Number of bits required to represent the sender window = ceil(log2(1+2*a)). But sometimes number of bits in the protocol headers is pre-defined. Size of sequence number field in header will also determine the maximum number of packets that we can send in total cycle time. If N is the size of sequence number field in the header in bits, then we can have 2N sequence numbers. Window Size ws = min(1+2*a, 2N) If you want to calculate minimum bits required to represent sequence numbers/sender window, it will be ceil(log2(ws)). In this article, we have discussed sending window only. For receiving window, there are 2 protocols namely Go Back N and Selective Repeat which are used to implement pipelining practically. We will be discussing receiving window in set 2."
There are two types of Sliding Window Protocol which include Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ:
"Go-Back-N ARQ allows sending more than one frame before getting the first frame’s acknowledgment. It is also known as sliding window protocol since it makes use of the sliding window notion. There is a limit to the amount of frames that can be sent, and they are numbered consecutively. All frames beginning with that frame are retransmitted if the acknowledgment is not received in a timely manner. For more detail visit the page Go-Back-N ARQ."
"Additionally, this protocol allows additional frames to be sent before the first frame’s acknowledgment is received. But in this case, the excellent frames are received and buffered, and only the incorrect or lost frames are retransmitted. Check the detailed explanation of Selective Repeat ARQ."
"Reliable data transfers are one of the primary concerns in computer networking. This service department lies in the hands of TCP. Their major flow control protocols – Stop and Wait, Go Back N, and Selective Repeat."
"Computer Networking is the practice of connecting computers together to enable communication and data exchange between them. In general, Computer Network is a collection of two or more computers. It helps users to communicate more easily. In this article, we are going to discuss the basics which everyone must know before going deep into Computer Networking."
"Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links. A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more. Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks."
"The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate. Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device."
"These are just a few basic concepts of computer networking. Networking is a vast and complex field, and there are many more concepts and technologies involved in building and maintaining networks. Now we are going to discuss some more concepts on Computer Networking."
"An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges."
"The Network Topology is the layout arrangement of the different devices in a network. Common examples include Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, and Daisy chain."
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer. The OSI has been developed by the International Organization For Standardization and it is 7 layer architecture. Each layer of OSI has different functions and each layer has to follow different protocols. The 7 layers are as follows:
"A protocol is a set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network and there exists a different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model. A few such protocols are TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP, and so on."
"Hostname: Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as Hostname. Type “hostname” in the command prompt(Administrator Mode) and press ‘Enter’, this displays the hostname of your machine."
"IP Address (Internet Protocol address):  Also known as the Logical Address, the IP Address is the network address of the system across the network. To identify each device in the world-wide-web, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns an IPV4 (Version 4) address as a unique identifier to each device on the Internet. The length of an IPv4 address is 32 bits, hence, we have 232 IP addresses available. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits.Type “ipconfig” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this gives us the IP address of the device. MAC Address (Media Access Control address): Also known as physical address, the MAC Address is the unique identifier of each host and is associated with its NIC (Network Interface Card). A MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. The length of the MAC address is: 12-nibble/ 6 bytes/ 48 bits Type “ipconfig/all” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this gives us the MAC address. Port: A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. Any host may have multiple applications running, and each of these applications is identified using the port number on which they are running."
"A port number is a 16-bit integer, hence, we have 216 ports available which are categorized as shown below:"
"Number of ports: 65,536 Range: 0 – 65535 Type “netstat -a” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this lists all the ports being used."
Socket: The unique combination of IP address and Port number together is termed a Socket.
DNS Server: DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is basically a server that translates web addresses or URLs (ex: www.google.com) into their corresponding IP addresses. We don’t have to remember all the IP addresses of each and every website. The command ‘nslookup’ gives you the IP address of the domain you are looking for. This also provides information on our DNS Server. \
"ARP: ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is used to convert an IP address to its corresponding physical address(i.e., MAC Address). ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine. RARP: RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. As the name suggests, it provides the IP address of the device given a physical address as input. But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into the picture."
"Error is a condition when the receiver’s information does not match the sender’s information. During transmission, digital signals suffer from noise that can introduce errors in the binary bits traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0."
"Data (Implemented either at the Data link layer or Transport Layer of the OSI Model) may get scrambled by noise or get corrupted whenever a message is transmitted. To prevent such errors, error-detection codes are added as extra data to digital messages. This helps in detecting any errors that may have occurred during message transmission."
"A single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting in an incorrect or corrupted data unit."
"A multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors, they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or high-interference digital environments."
"When several consecutive bits are flipped mistakenly in digital transmission, it creates a burst error. This error causes a sequence of consecutive incorrect values."
"To detect errors, a common technique is to introduce redundancy bits that provide additional information. Various techniques for error detection include::"
Simple-bit parity is a simple error detection method that involves adding an extra bit to a data transmission. It works as:
"This scheme makes the total number of 1’s even, that is why it is called even parity checking."
"Two-dimensional Parity check bits are calculated for each row, which is equivalent to a simple parity check bit. Parity check bits are also calculated for all columns, then both are sent along with the data. At the receiving end, these are compared with the parity bits calculated on the received data."
"Checksum error detection is a method used to identify errors in transmitted data. The process involves dividing the data into equally sized segments and using a 1’s complement to calculate the sum of these segments. The calculated sum is then sent along with the data to the receiver. At the receiver’s end, the same process is repeated and if all zeroes are obtained in the sum, it means that the data is correct."
Example: Previous year GATE questions based on error detection: GATE CS 2009 Question 48 GATE CS 2007 Question 68. This article has been contributed by Vikash Kumar.
"Increased Data Reliability: Error detection ensures that the data transmitted over the network is reliable, accurate, and free from errors. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender."
Improved Network Performance: Error detection mechanisms can help to identify and isolate network issues that are causing errors. This can help to improve the overall performance of the network and reduce downtime.
Enhanced Data Security: Error detection can also help to ensure that the data transmitted over the network is secure and has not been tampered with.
"Overhead: Error detection requires additional resources and processing power, which can lead to increased overhead on the network. This can result in slower network performance and increased latency."
"False Positives: Error detection mechanisms can sometimes generate false positives, which can result in unnecessary retransmission of data. This can further increase the overhead on the network."
"Limited Error Correction: Error detection can only identify errors but cannot correct them. This means that the recipient must rely on the sender to retransmit the data, which can lead to further delays and increased network overhead."
"In data communication terminology, a transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:"
1. Guided Media: It is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media. Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links. Features:
"There are 3 major types of Guided Media: (i) Twisted Pair Cable – It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely used Transmission Media. Twisted Pair is of two types:"
⇢ Better performance at a higher data rate in comparison to UTP
"The shielded twisted pair type of cable is most frequently used in extremely cold climates, where the additional layer of outer covering makes it perfect for withstanding such temperatures or for shielding the interior components."
(ii) Coaxial Cable – It has an outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges). Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.
"Radio frequency signals are sent over coaxial wire. It can be used for cable television signal distribution, digital audio (S/PDIF), computer network connections (like Ethernet), and feedlines that connect radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas."
(iii) Optical Fiber Cable – It uses the concept of refraction of light through a core made up of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding. It is used for the transmission of large volumes of data.
"The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode."
Stripline is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) transmission line medium invented by Robert M. Barrett of the Air Force Cambridge Research Centre in the 1950s. Stripline is the earliest form of the planar transmission line. It uses a conducting material to transmit high-frequency waves it is also called a waveguide. This conducting material is sandwiched between two layers of the ground plane which are usually shorted to provide EMI immunity.
"In this, the conducting material is separated from the ground plane by a layer of dielectric."
2. Unguided Media: It is also referred to as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media. No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals. Features:
There are 3 types of Signals transmitted through unguided media: (i) Radio waves – These are easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings. The sending and receiving antennas need not be aligned. Frequency Range:3KHz – 1GHz. AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission.
Further Categorized as (i) Terrestrial and (ii) Satellite. (ii) Microwaves – It is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna. Frequency Range:1GHz – 300GHz. These are majorly used for mobile phone communication and television distribution.
"(iii) Infrared – Infrared waves are used for very short distance communication. They cannot penetrate through obstacles. This prevents interference between systems. Frequency Range:300GHz – 400THz. It is used in TV remotes, wireless mouse, keyboard, printer, etc."
Please refer this as a prerequisite article: Sliding Window Protocol (sender side)| set 1 Sliding Window Protocol is actually a theoretical concept in which we have only talked about what should be the sender window size (1+2a) in order to increase the efficiency of stop and wait arq. Now we will talk about the practical implementations in which we take care of what should be the size of receiver window. Practically it is implemented in two protocols namely :
"In this article, we will explain you about the first protocol which is GBN in terms of three main characteristic features and in the next part we will be discussing SR as well as comparison of both these protocols"
"What will be the efficiency if processing delay, queuing delay and transmission delay of acknowledgement is not zero."
Relationship Between Window Sizes and Sequence Numbers We already know that sequence numbers required should always be equal to the size of window in any sliding window protocol.
"This is explained with the help of the illustrations below. Trying with Sequence numbers 4.  Now Trying with one extra Sequence Number.  Now it is clear as to why we need an extra 1 bit in the GBN protocol. In the next article, we will explain Selective repeat and comparison between the 2 proto"
"Trunk ports are ports that are used to carry the traffic of more than one VLAN. The port which connects two different switches and the switches have more than one VLAN configured then that port should be made trunk. If all the VLANs are allowed then trunk ports will carry traffic of all the VLANs including native VLANs for which the traffic goes untagged otherwise only the allowed VLANs traffic will be carried by the trunk link. The trunk link traffic would be encapsulated or tagged either by ISL or 802.1Q. By default, all switch ports are access ports therefore to make a port trunk, the user should manually make it trunk by using DTP. Dynamic Trunking Protocol – Dynamic Trunking Protocol is CISCO proprietary protocol used for negotiating a trunk link between two switches as well as the encapsulation type of either 802.1q or ISL (Generally, 802.1q is used because ISL has more overhead than 802.1q). Of course, It is a layer 2 (data link) protocol and is enabled by default. Here are the different options available while configuring a switch interface:- switchport mode access (DTP mode OFF) – This mode puts the switch interface into permanent non-trunking mode regardless of whether the neighbouring interface is a trunk port or trying to become a trunk port that is why it is known as DTP mode OFF. The port is a dedicated layer 2 access port. switchport mode trunk (DTP mode ON) – It puts the interface into trunking mode. The interface will become a trunk interface even if the neighbouring ports are trunk or not that is why it is called DTP mode ON. switchport mode dynamic auto – This is a default mode on the older CISCO switches. This mode makes the interface able to convert to a trunk link. The interface will become a trunk link if the neighbouring interface is set to trunk or desirable mode. If both switches interface mode is auto, then the trunk will not be formed. switchport mode dynamic desirable – By this mode, the interface will actively attempt to convert the link into a trunk link. The interface will become a trunk port if the neighbouring interface is set to trunk, desirable or auto. switchport nonegotiate – This mode prevents the interface from generating DTP frames. This command is used only when the switch port mode is access or trunk. You must manually configure the neighbouring interface as a trunk interface to establish a trunk link. Now, let’s see the scenarios in which the switch interface will either become a trunk or access interface."
"By observing this, it is clear that whenever you receive a DTP packet that requests to form a trunk, your interface will be in trunk mode."
"The Network allows computers to connect and communicate with different computers via any medium. LAN, MAN, and WAN are the three major types of networks designed to operate over the area they cover. There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them. One of the major differences is the geographical area they cover, i.e. LAN covers the smallest area, MAN covers an area larger than LAN and WAN comprises the largest of all. There are other types of Computer Networks also, like :"
"PAN is a personal area network having an interconnection of personal technology devices to communicate over a short distance. It covers only less than 10 meters or 33 feet of area. PAN has fewer users as compared to other networks such as LAN, WAN, etc. PAN typically uses some form of wireless technology. PAN involves the transmission of data between information devices such as smartphones, personal computers, tablet computers, etc."
"LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. Private addresses are unique in relation to other computers on the local network. Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN."
"Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked is limited. By definition, the connections must be high-speed and relatively inexpensive hardware (Such as hubs, network adapters, and Ethernet cables). LANs cover a smaller geographical area (Size is limited to a few kilometres) and are privately owned. One can use it for an office building, home, hospital, school, etc. LAN is easy to design and maintain. A Communication medium used for LAN has twisted-pair cables and coaxial cables. It covers a short distance, and so the error and noise are minimized."
"Early LANs had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps. Propagation delay is very short in a LAN. The smallest LAN may only use two computers, while larger LANs can accommodate thousands of computers. LAN has a range up to 2km. A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN. The fault tolerance of a LAN is more and there is less congestion in this network. For example A bunch of students playing Counter-Strike in the same room (without internet)."
MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that covered by a LAN and a smaller area as compared to WAN. MAN has a range of 5-50km. It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same or different cities. It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an ISP (Internet Service Provider). MAN is designed for customers who need high-speed connectivity. Speeds of MAN range in terms of Mbps. It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.
The fault tolerance of a MAN is less and also there is more congestion in the network. It is costly and may or may not be owned by a single organization. The data transfer rate and the propagation delay of MAN are moderate. Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are Modem and Wire/Cable. Examples of a MAN are part of the telephone company network that can provide a high-speed DSL line to the customer or the cable TV network in a city.
"WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. WAN has a range of above 50 km. A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive."
"There are two types of WAN: Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN. WAN is difficult to design and maintain. Similar to a MAN, the fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network. A Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN or Satellite Link. Due to long-distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN."
"WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed since it involves increased distance and increased number of servers and terminals etc. The speed of WAN ranges from a few kilobits per second (Kbps) to megabits per second (Mbps). Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here. Devices used for the transmission of data through WAN are Optic wires, Microwaves, and Satellites. An example of a Switched WAN is the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network and Point-to-Point WAN is a dial-up line that connects a home computer to the Internet."
"Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a concept in which we can divide the devices logically on layer 2 (data link layer). Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but the broadcast domain can be divided by switches using the concept of VLAN. A broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the devices in the same broadcast domain will receive it. The devices in the same broadcast domain will receive all the broadcast packets but it is limited to switches only as routers don’t forward out the broadcast packet. To forward out the packets to different VLAN (from one VLAN to another) or broadcast domains, inter Vlan routing is needed. Through VLAN, different small-size sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle."
Configuration – We can simply create VLANs by simply assigning the vlan-id and Vlan name.
"Here, 2 is the Vlan I’d and accounts is the Vlan name. Now, we assign Vlan to the switch ports.e.g-"
"By this, switchport fa0/0, fa0/1, fa0-2 will be assigned Vlan 2."
"Assigning IP address 192.168.1.1/24, 192.168.1.2/24 and 192.168.2.1/24 to the PC’s. Now, we will create Vlan 2 and 3 on switch."
We have made VLANs but the most important part is to assign switch ports to the VLANs.
