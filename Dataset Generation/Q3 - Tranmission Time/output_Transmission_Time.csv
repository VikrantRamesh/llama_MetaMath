  **Transmission time** is the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination. It is directly proportional to the length of the packet and inversely proportional to the bandwidth.

**Bandwidth** is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time. It is measured in bits per second (bps). The higher the bandwidth, the faster the data can be transmitted.

**Length of packet** is the number of bits in a packet. The longer the packet, the more time it will take to transmit.

These three factors are interrelated. For example, if you increase the bandwidth, you can transmit more data in a given amount of time. However, if you also increase the length of the packets, the transmission time will increase. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between these three factors to optimize network performance.
