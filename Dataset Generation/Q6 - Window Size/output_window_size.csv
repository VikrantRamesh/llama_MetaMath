  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows for efficient and reliable data transfer over unreliable networks. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, allowing for multiple packets to be transmitted and acknowledged simultaneously. The window size determines the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted before an acknowledgment is required, with a larger window size allowing for higher throughput but potentially increasing the risk of packet loss.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 4 KB * 8 = 32 Kb
  bandwidth (B) = 1.5 Mbps = 1.5 * 10^6 bps
  propagation delay (T_{p}) = 40 ms
  Utilization (U) = 80% = 0.8

  The transition delay is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=(32 Kb)/(1.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(32*1000 b)/(1.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(32000 b)/(1.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=0.02133 sec$
  $T_{t}=21.33msec$

  let n be the window size.
  Utilization of a network is given by:
  $Utilization = n/(1+2a)$

  $where a = Propagation time (T_{p})/ transmission time (T_{t})$
  $a = T_{p}/T_{t}$
  $a =  40/21.33
  $a = 1.88

  Subsituting in the formula:
  $UtiliZation = n/(1+2*a)$
  $n = UtiliZation*(1+2*a)$
  $n = 0.8*(1+2*1.88)$
  $n = 0.8*(1+3.76)$

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a flow control technique used in computer networks to ensure reliable data transmission. It allows a sender to transmit multiple frames within a specified window size, and the receiver can selectively acknowledge and request retransmission of lost or corrupted frames. The window size determines the number of frames that can be transmitted before an acknowledgment is required, and it affects the efficiency and performance of the protocol.

  **Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol:**

The selective repeat sliding window protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to send multiple packets at once and the receiver to acknowledge them individually. It uses a sliding window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent and received, allowing for efficient retransmission of lost packets.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to retransmit only the lost or corrupted packets, rather than the entire data stream. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, where the sender maintains a window of packets that can be transmitted before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. The window size determines the maximum number of packets that can be sent without acknowledgment, and it affects the efficiency and reliability of the protocol. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but increases the risk of packet loss, while a smaller window size reduces the risk of packet loss but decreases the throughput.

The receiver maintains a window of frames that it is expecting to receive. If a frame is lost or corrupted, the receiver can request that the sender retransmit only the lost or corrupted frame.

The window size is the number of frames that the sender can send without waiting for an acknowledgment. The window size is typically set to a value that is large enough to allow the sender to send multiple frames without waiting for an acknowledgment, but not so large that the sender is likely to send frames that will be lost or corrupted.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a receiver to selectively acknowledge received data segments and request retransmission of lost or corrupted segments. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, where the sender maintains a window of outstanding segments that can be sent without waiting for an acknowledgment. The window size determines the maximum number of segments that can be transmitted without acknowledgment, and it affects the efficiency and performance of the protocol. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but may increase the risk of retransmissions, while a smaller window size reduces retransmissions but limits throughput.

  **Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol:**

The selective repeat sliding window protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to send multiple packets at once and the receiver to acknowledge them individually. It uses a sliding window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent and received, allowing for efficient retransmission of lost packets.

**Window Size:**

The window size in a sliding window protocol refers to the maximum number of packets that can be sent or received at any given time. A larger window size allows for higher throughput, but also increases the risk of packet loss due to congestion. The optimal window size depends on the characteristics of the network, such as bandwidth, latency, and packet loss rate.

93,"What is the approximate window size for a selective repeat sliding window protocol that uses a frame size of 4 KB to send data on a 0.5 Mbps link with a one-way latency of 90 msec, aiming for a link utilization of 80%?","
  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to transmit multiple frames at once and the receiver to acknowledge each frame individually. The window size is the number of frames that the sender can transmit before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. A larger window size allows for higher throughput, but it also increases the risk of data loss if a frame is lost or corrupted.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 4 KB * 8 = 32 Kb
  bandwidth (B) = 0.5 Mbps = 0.5 * 10^6 bps

  The transition delay is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=(32 Kb)/(0.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(32*1000 b)/(0.5*10^6 b)$
