0,The window size of a selective repeat sliding window protocol is to be determined. The protocol uses a frame size of 4 KB and operates on a 1.5 Mbps link with a one-way latency of 40 msec. The desired link utilization is 80%.,"
  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows for efficient and reliable data transfer over unreliable networks. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, allowing for multiple packets to be transmitted and acknowledged simultaneously. The window size determines the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted before an acknowledgment is required, with a larger window size allowing for higher throughput but potentially increasing the risk of packet loss.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 4 KB * 8 = 32 Kb
  bandwidth (B) = 1.5 Mbps = 1.5 * 10^6 bps
  propagation delay (T_{p}) = 40 ms

  The transition delay is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=(32 Kb)/(1.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(32*1000 b)/(1.5*10^6 b)$

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to retransmit only the lost or corrupted packets, rather than the entire data stream. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, where the sender maintains a window of packets that can be transmitted before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. The window size determines the maximum number of packets that can be sent without acknowledgment, and it affects the efficiency and reliability of the protocol. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but increases the risk of packet loss, while a smaller window size reduces the risk of packet loss but decreases the throughput.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol:

In computer networks, the Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol (SR-SWP) is a data transmission protocol that allows the receiver to selectively acknowledge and request retransmission of lost or corrupted data packets. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, ensuring reliable and efficient data transfer.

Window Size:

The window size in SR-SWP refers to the number of packets that the sender can transmit before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. A larger window size allows for higher throughput, as the sender can send more packets without waiting for acknowledgments. However, a smaller window size can improve reliability by reducing the number of packets that need to be retransmitted in case of packet loss.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 1 KB * 8 = 8 Kb
  bandwidth (B) = 3.5 Mbps = 3.5 * 10^6 bps
  propagation delay (T_{p}) = 40 ms
  Utilization (U) = 90% = 0.9

  The transition delay is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=(8 Kb)/(3.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(8*1000 b)/(3.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(8000 b)/(3.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=0.00229 sec$

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a reliable transport layer protocol that allows a sender to retransmit only the lost or corrupted packets, rather than the entire transmission.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a reliable data transfer protocol that allows a receiver to selectively acknowledge received packets, enabling efficient retransmission of lost or corrupted packets. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data, where the receiver advertises a window size to the sender, indicating the number of packets it can receive before an acknowledgment is required. The sender maintains a window of packets that it can send without waiting for an acknowledgment, and it slides the window forward as acknowledgments are received. This allows for efficient data transfer and reduces the impact of lost or corrupted packets.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a reliable data transmission protocol that allows the sender to transmit multiple frames simultaneously within a specified window size. The receiver acknowledges each frame individually, and the sender retransmits only the unacknowledged frames. The window size determines the number of frames that can be transmitted before an acknowledgment is required, and it affects the efficiency and reliability of the protocol. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but increases the risk of retransmission in case of errors, while a smaller window size reduces the risk of retransmission but limits the throughput.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 1 KB * 8 = 8 Kb
  bandwidth (B) = 2.5 Mbps = 2.5 * 10^6 bps
  propagation delay (T_{p}) = 50 ms
  Utilization (U) = 90% = 0.9

  The transition delay is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=(8 Kb)/(2.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(8*1000 b)/(2.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=(8000 b)/(2.5*10^6 b)$
  $T_{t}=0.0032 sec$

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows the sender to send multiple packets at once and the receiver to acknowledge each packet individually. The window size determines the number of packets that can be sent or received before an acknowledgment is required, and it is used to control the flow of data between the sender and receiver. A larger window size allows for more efficient data transfer, but it also increases the risk of data loss if a packet is lost or corrupted.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to retransmit only the lost or corrupted packets, rather than the entire data stream. It uses a sliding window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent and acknowledged.

  **Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol:**

The selective repeat sliding window protocol is a reliable data transfer protocol that allows for efficient retransmission of lost or corrupted data packets. It maintains a sliding window of packets that the sender can transmit, and the receiver can acknowledge.

**Window Size:**

The window size in a sliding window protocol determines the maximum number of packets that the sender can transmit before waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but increases the risk of packet loss. A smaller window size reduces the risk of packet loss but decreases throughput.

  Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol is a data transmission protocol that allows a sender to transmit multiple frames without waiting for an acknowledgment for each frame. The sender maintains a window of frames that it can send without waiting for an acknowledgment. The window size is the number of frames that the sender can send without waiting for an acknowledgment.
