  Congestion control is a set of techniques used in computer networks to prevent the network from becoming overloaded. Slow start is a specific congestion control algorithm that is used in the TCP protocol. When a TCP connection is established, the sender starts by sending a small number of packets.

  Congestion control is a set of techniques used in computer networks to prevent network congestion. It aims to ensure that the network resources are utilized efficiently and fairly, avoiding situations where some users or applications monopolize the bandwidth, leading to poor performance for others.

It starts by sending a small number of packets and gradually increases the number of packets sent as long as there is no congestion. If congestion is detected, the number of packets sent is reduced. Slow start helps to prevent congestion by gradually increasing the traffic load and allowing the network to adjust.

  Congestion control is a set of techniques used to prevent network congestion by regulating the rate at which data is sent over a network. Slow start is a congestion control algorithm that starts by sending a small amount of data and gradually increases the amount of data sent until congestion is detected.

  Congestion control is a set of techniques used in computer networks to prevent network congestion. It works by regulating the rate at which data is sent into the network, ensuring that the network can handle the traffic load.

Slow start is a congestion control algorithm that is used in TCP. It starts by sending a small amount of data into the network and then gradually increases the amount of data sent until the network becomes congested. When congestion is detected, the algorithm reduces the amount of data sent until the congestion is resolved.
