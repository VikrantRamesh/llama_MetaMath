  Latency refers to the time delay experienced by data as it travels through a network. It encompasses various components:

* **Propagation delay:** Time taken for data to traverse the physical medium, determined by the distance and speed of the signal.
* **Queuing delay:** Time spent waiting in buffers before transmission due to network congestion or limited processing capacity.
* **Transmission delay:** Time required to transmit data over the network medium, dependent on the data size and transmission rate.
* **Processing delay:** Time taken by network devices to process and forward data, including routing, switching, and error correction.

  Latency, in network communication, refers to the time taken for data to travel from its source to its destination. It encompasses four main components:

- **Propagation delay:** Time taken for data to travel through the physical medium, such as cables or fiber optics.

  Latency, also known as network delay, refers to the time it takes for data to travel from a source to a destination. It is influenced by several factors:

* **Propagation delay:** The time it takes for data to physically travel through a network medium, such as a cable or fiber optic.
* **Queuing delay:** The time data spends waiting in a queue before being processed by a network device, such as a router or switch.
* **Transmission delay:** The time it takes for data to be transmitted over a network medium.
* **Processing delay:** The time it takes for a network device to process and forward data.

  Latency, or end-to-end delay, is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination. It is the sum of propagation delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and processing delay.

* **Propagation delay** is the time it takes for a signal to travel through a physical medium, such as a cable or fiber optic.
* **Queuing delay** is the time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted.
* **Transmission delay** is the time it takes to transmit a packet over a network link.
* **Processing delay** is the time it takes for a device to process a packet, such as a router or switch.

* **Propagation delay** is the time it takes for a signal to travel over a physical medium, such as a wire or fiber optic cable.
* **Queuing delay** is the time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted.
* **Transmission delay** is the time it takes to transmit a packet over a network link.
* **Processing delay** is the time it takes for a router or switch to process a packet.

  Latency, or end-to-end delay, is the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination. It is composed of four main components:

* **Propagation delay:** The time it takes for data to travel through the physical medium, such as a cable or fiber optic.
* **Queuing delay:** The time data spends waiting in a queue before being processed by a device, such as a router or switch.
* **Transmission delay:** The time it takes for data to be transmitted from one device to another, such as from a computer to a router.
* **Processing delay:** The time it takes for a device to process data, such as a router to forward a packet.
