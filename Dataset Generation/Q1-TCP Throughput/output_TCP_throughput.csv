It is an important metric for network performance, as it affects the throughput and latency of the network.

To find the RTT of the network, we can use the following formula:

$RTT = MSS/(Throughput * \sqrt{p})$

It is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of TCP data transmission.

MSS is the largest amount of data that can be transmitted in a single TCP segment. It is negotiated during the TCP handshake and affects the efficiency of data transfer. A larger MSS can reduce the number of segments required to transmit a given amount of data, improving throughput. However, MSS must be carefully chosen to avoid fragmentation and excessive retransmissions.

**Calculating MSS:**

To find the MSS of the TCP connection, we can use the following formula:

$MSS = ((throughput * RTT) * \sqrt{p})$

where:

* throughput is the TCP throughput in bytes per second
* RTT is the round trip time in seconds
* p is the packet loss rate

**Converting units:**

Before substituting the values into the formula, we need to convert the throughput from kilobytes per second (KB/s) to bytes per second (B/s) and the RTT from milliseconds (ms) to seconds (s):

* throughput = 6.4 KB/s = 6.4 * 1024 B/s = 6553.6 B/s
