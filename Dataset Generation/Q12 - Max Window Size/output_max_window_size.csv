  **Sliding Window Protocol:**

A sliding window protocol is a flow control mechanism in computer networks that allows a sender to transmit multiple packets before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. It uses a window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent but not yet acknowledged.

**Window Size:**

The window size is the maximum number of packets that can be sent before an acknowledgment is required. A larger window size allows for higher throughput, as the sender can send more packets without waiting for acknowledgments. However, a smaller window size reduces the risk of packet loss and retransmission, as the sender will receive acknowledgments more frequently.

  $a = T_{p}/T_{t}$
  $a = 384.0/16.0$
  $a = 24.0$

  for maximum utilization:
  $UtiliZation = 1 = n/(1+2*a)$

  subsitituting the given values:
  $n = (1+2*a)$
  $n = 1+2*24.0$
  $n = 1+48.0$
  $n = 49.0

  Maximum window size is 49.0
  The answer is: 49.0",49
99,Station A uses 32 byte packets to transmit messages to Station B using a sliding window protocol. The round trip delay between A and B is 4000 ms and the bottleneck bandwidth on the path between A and B is 8 kbps. What is the optimal window size that A should use? ,"
  **Sliding Window Protocol:**

A flow control technique in computer networks that allows a sender to transmit multiple packets before receiving an acknowledgment, improving efficiency by reducing latency and increasing throughput.

**Window Size:**

The number of packets that a sender can transmit without receiving an acknowledgment. A larger window size allows for higher throughput but increases the risk of packet loss and congestion. The optimal window size depends on network conditions and is dynamically adjusted by the protocol.

  given values:
  Frame Size (f) = 32 * 8 bits = 256
  Round trip time (RTT) = 4000 ms
  bandwidth (B) = 8 kbps

  The transition time is given by:
  $transition time(T_{t})=Frame size(f)/Bandwidth(B)$
  $T_{t}=256/8$
  $T_{t}=32.0$

  The RTT between two devices is given as:
  $RTT = transition time(T_{t}) + 2 * propagation time(T_{p})$
  $RTT = T_{t} + 2 * T_{p}$
  $T_{p} = (RTT - T_{t})/2$
  $T_{p} = (4000 - 32.0)/2$
  $T_{p} = (3968.0)/2$
  $T_{p} = 1984.0$

  let n be the window size.
  Utilization of a network is given by:
  $Utilization = n/(1+2a)$

  $where a = Propagation time (T_{p})/ transmission time (T_{t})$
  $a = T_{p}/T_{t}$
  $a = 1984.0/32.0$
  $a = 62.0$

  for maximum utilization:
  $UtiliZation = 1 = n/(1+2*a)$

  subsitituting the given values:
  $n = (1+2*a)$
  $n = 1+2*62.0$
  $n = 1+124.0$
  $n = 125.0

  Maximum window size is 125.0
  The answer is: 125.0",125
