  **Sliding Window Protocol:**

A sliding window protocol is a flow control mechanism in computer networks that allows a sender to transmit multiple packets before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. It uses a window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent but not yet acknowledged.

**Window Size:**

The window size is the maximum number of packets that can be sent before an acknowledgment is required. A larger window size allows for higher throughput, as the sender can send more packets without waiting for acknowledgments. However, a smaller window size reduces the risk of packet loss and retransmission, as the sender will receive acknowledgments more frequently.

  **Sliding Window Protocol:**

A sliding window protocol is a flow control mechanism in computer networks that allows a sender to transmit multiple packets before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver. It uses a window to track the sequence numbers of packets that have been sent but not yet acknowledged.
