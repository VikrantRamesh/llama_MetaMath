  Frame size directly affects propagation delay, transmission delay, bandwidth, and jamming signal length. Larger frame sizes result in increased propagation delay due to the longer time it takes for the signal to travel the distance between sender and receiver. Transmission delay also increases with frame size, as more time is needed to transmit the larger amount of data. Bandwidth requirements increase with frame size, as a wider bandwidth is needed to accommodate the higher data rate.

  $Round Trip Time = 2 * Propagation delay$
  $Round Trip Time = 0.08530967695363231 seconds$
  $Tranmission Delay = 0.08530967695363231 + 7.090294038261556e-06 seconds$
  $Minimum Frame size =(0.08530967695363231 + 7.090294038261556e-06) * 29194840  $
  $Minimum Frame size = 2490809.369 bits$
The answer is 2490809.369 bits.",2490.809369
99,"What is the minimum frame size required for a 29830771 bps Ethernet network to accommodate a 101-bit jamming signal, considering a round trip propagation delay of 0.0673579436004117 seconds?","
  Frame size is the number of bits in a frame. It affects propagation delay, transmission delay, bandwidth, and jamming signal length.

* **Propagation delay:** The time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of the network to the other. Larger frame sizes increase propagation delay.
* **Transmission delay:** The time it takes to transmit a frame. Larger frame sizes increase transmission delay.
* **Bandwidth:** The amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time. Larger frame sizes decrease bandwidth.
* **Jamming signal length:** The length of a jamming signal needed to disrupt a transmission. Larger frame sizes increase jamming signal length.
  To find the Minimum Frame size, we can use the formula given below.

  Given values:
  Bandwidth = 29830771 bps

  Jamming signal= 101

  Propagation delay: 0.0673579436004117 seconds

  Required Formula:

  $Minimum Frame Size =  Transmission delay * Bandwidth$

  $Tranmission Delay = Round Trip Time + (Jamming signal / Bandwidth)$

  $Round Trip Time = 2 * Propagation delay$


  Substituting the values:
  $Round Trip Time = 2 * Propagation delay$
  $Round Trip Time = 0.1347158872008234 seconds$
  $Tranmission Delay = 0.1347158872008234 + 3.385765657883935e-06 seconds$
  $Minimum Frame size =(0.1347158872008234 + 3.385765657883935e-06) * 29830771  $
  $Minimum Frame size = 4018779.781 bits$
The answer is 4018779.781 bits.",4018.779781
