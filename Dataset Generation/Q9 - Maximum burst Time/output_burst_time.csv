It works by issuing tokens at a constant rate, and each token represents the permission to send a certain amount of data. When a device wants to send data, it must first acquire a token from the bucket. If there are no tokens available, the device must wait until a token becomes available.

The maximum burst time is the maximum amount of data that can be sent without waiting for a token. This allows devices to send short bursts of data without being delayed by the token bucket.
