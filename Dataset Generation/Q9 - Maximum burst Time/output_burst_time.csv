The token bucket is initially filled to capacity with 152 Megabits and is filled at a rate of 23 Mbps. What is this maximum duration?,"
  A token bucket is a traffic shaping mechanism that controls the rate at which data can be transmitted on a network. It works by issuing a fixed number of tokens at a constant rate. Each token represents the permission to transmit a fixed amount of data. When a device wants to transmit data, it must first acquire a token from the bucket. If there are no tokens available, the device must wait until a token becomes available.

The maximum burst time is the maximum amount of time that a device can transmit data without acquiring a token. This allows devices to send short bursts of data without having to wait for a token. The maximum burst time is typically set to a value that is slightly larger than the average packet size.
